description: This delightful comedy of errors tells the story of a bunch of society
  types who become sequestered together for a week when the house they are visiting
  is put under quarantine for smallpox. There are characters posing as a couple to
  placate a nosy aunt; missing jewels; and guests who consider it a struggle to survive
  a week without servants. A witty romp full of hilarious twists and turns.
