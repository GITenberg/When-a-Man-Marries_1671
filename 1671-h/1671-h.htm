    <h2>
      Chapter I. AT LEAST I MEANT WELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the dreadful thing occurred that night, every one turned on me. The
      injustice of it hurt me most. They said I got up the dinner, that I asked
      them to give up other engagements and come, that I promised all kinds of
      jollification, if they would come; and then when they did come and got in
      the papers and every one&mdash;but ourselves&mdash;laughed himself black
      in the face, they turned on ME! I, who suffered ten times to their one! I
      shall never forget what Dallas Brown said to me, standing with a coal
      shovel in one hand and a&mdash;well, perhaps it would be better to tell it
      all in the order it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began with Jimmy Wilson and a conspiracy, was helped on by a
      foot-square piece of yellow paper and a Japanese butler, and it enmeshed
      and mixed up generally ten respectable members of society and a policeman.
      Incidentally, it involved a pearl collar and a box of soap, which sounds
      incongruous, doesn&rsquo;t it?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a great misfortune to be stout, especially for a man. Jim was rotund
      and looked shorter than he really was, and as all the lines of his face,
      or what should have been lines, were really dimples, his face was about as
      flexible and full of expression as a pillow in a tight cover. The angrier
      he got the funnier he looked, and when he was raging, and his neck swelled
      up over his collar and got red, he was entrancing. And everybody liked
      him, and borrowed money from him, and laughed at his pictures (he has one
      in the Hargrave gallery in London now, so people buy them instead), and
      smoked his cigarettes, and tried to steal his Jap. The whole story hinges
      on the Jap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble was, I think, that no one took Jim seriously. His ambition in
      life was to be taken seriously, but people steadily refused to. His art
      was a huge joke&mdash;except to himself. If he asked people to dinner,
      every one expected a frolic. When he married Bella Knowles, people
      chuckled at the wedding, and considered it the wildest prank of Jimmy&rsquo;s
      career, although Jim himself seemed to take it awfully hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had all known them both for years. I went to Farmington with Bella, and
      Anne Brown was her matron of honor when she married Jim. My first winter
      out, Jimmy had paid me a lot of attention. He painted my portrait in oils
      and had a studio tea to exhibit it. It was a very nice picture, but it did
      not look like me, so I stayed away from the exhibition. Jim asked me to.
      He said he was not a photographer, and that anyhow the rest of my features
      called for the nose he had given me, and that all the Greuze women have
      long necks. I have not.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had refused Jim twice he met Bella at a camp in the Adirondacks
      and when he came back he came at once to see me. He seemed to think I
      would be sorry to lose him, and he blundered over the telling for twenty
      minutes. Of course, no woman likes to lose a lover, no matter what she may
      say about it, but Jim had been getting on my nerves for some time, and I
      was much calmer than he expected me to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean,&rdquo; I said finally in desperation, &ldquo;that you and Bella are&mdash;are
      in love, why don&rsquo;t you say so, Jim? I think you will find that I stand it
      wonderfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He brightened perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how you would take it, Kit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I hope we will
      always be bully friends. You are absolutely sure you don&rsquo;t care a whoop
      for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; I replied, and we shook hands on it. Then he began about
      Bella; it was very tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella is a nice girl, but I had roomed with her at school, and I was under
      no illusions. When Jim raved about Bella and her banjo, and Bella and her
      guitar, I had painful moments when I recalled Bella, learning her two
      songs on each instrument, and the old English ballad she had learned to
      play on the harp. When he said she was too good for him, I never batted an
      eye. And I shook hands solemnly across the tea-table again, and wished him
      happiness&mdash;which was sincere enough, but hopeless&mdash;and said we
      had only been playing a game, but that it was time to stop playing. Jim
      kissed my hand, and it was really very touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been the best of friends ever since. Two days before the wedding he
      came around from his tailor&rsquo;s, and we burned all his letters to me. He
      would read one and say: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a crackerjack, Kit,&rdquo; and pass it to me.
      And after I had read it we would lay it on the firelog, and Jim would say,
      &ldquo;I am not worthy of her, Kit. I wonder if I can make her happy?&rdquo; Or&mdash;&ldquo;Did
      you know that the Duke of Belford proposed to her in London last winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, one has to take the woman&rsquo;s word about a thing like that, but
      the Duke of Belford had been mad about Maude Richard all that winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see that the burning of the letters, which was meant to be
      reminiscently sentimental, a sort of how-silly-we-were-but-it-is
      all-over-now occasion, became actually a two hours&rsquo; eulogy of Bella. And
      just when I was bored to death, the Mercer girls dropped in and heard Jim
      begin to read one commencing &ldquo;dearest Kit.&rdquo; And the next day after the
      rehearsal dinner, they told Bella!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was very nearly no wedding at all. Bella came to see me in a frenzy
      the next morning and threw Jim and his two-hundred odd pounds in my face,
      and although I explained it all over and over, she never quite forgave me.
      That was what made it so hard later&mdash;the situation would have been
      bad enough without that complication.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went abroad on their wedding journey, and stayed several months. And
      when Jim came back he was fatter than ever. Everybody noticed it. Bella
      had a gymnasium fitted up in a corner of the studio, but he would not use
      it. He smoked a pipe and painted all day, and drank beer and WOULD eat
      starches or whatever it is that is fattening. But he adored Bella, and he
      was madly jealous of her. At dinners he used to glare at the man who took
      her in, although it did not make him thin. Bella was flirting, too, and by
      the time they had been married a year, people hitched their chairs
      together and dropped their voices when they were mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, on the anniversary of the day Bella left him&mdash;oh yes, she left
      him finally. She was intense enough about some things, and she said it got
      on her nerves to have everybody chuckle when they asked for her husband.
      They would say, &ldquo;Hello, Bella! How&rsquo;s Bubbles? Still banting?&rdquo; And Bella
      would try to laugh and say, &ldquo;He swears his tailor says his waist is
      smaller, but if it is he must be growing hollow in the back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she got tired of it at last. Well, on the second anniversary of
      Bella&rsquo;s departure, Jimmy was feeling pretty glum, and as I say, I am very
      fond of Jim. The divorce had just gone through and Bella had taken her
      maiden name again and had had an operation for appendicitis. We heard
      afterward that they didn&rsquo;t find an appendix, and that the one they showed
      her in a glass jar WAS NOT HERS! But if Bella ever suspected, she didn&rsquo;t
      say. Whether the appendix was anonymous or not, she got box after box of
      flowers that were, and of course every one knew that it was Jim who sent
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go back to the anniversary, I went to Rothberg&rsquo;s to see the collection
      of antique furniture&mdash;mother was looking for a sideboard for father&rsquo;s
      birthday in March&mdash;and I met Jimmy there, boring into a worm-hole in
      a seventeenth-century bedpost with the end of a match, and looking his
      nearest to sad. When he saw me he came over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blue today, Kit,&rdquo; he said, after we had shaken hands. &ldquo;Come and help
      me dig bait, and then let&rsquo;s go fishing. If there&rsquo;s a worm in every hole in
      that bedpost, we could go into the fish business. It&rsquo;s a good business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than painting?&rdquo; I asked. But he ignored my gibe and swelled up
      alarmingly in order to sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the worst day of the year for me,&rdquo; he affirmed, staring straight
      ahead, &ldquo;and the longest. Look at that crazy clock over there. If you want
      to see your life passing away, if you want to see the steps by which you
      are marching to eternity, watch that clock marking the time. Look at that
      infernal hand staying quiet for sixty seconds and then jumping forward to
      catch up with the procession. Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Jim,&rdquo; I said, leaning forward, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not well. You can&rsquo;t go
      through the rest of the day like this. I know what you&rsquo;ll do; you&rsquo;ll go
      home to play Grieg on the pianola, and you won&rsquo;t eat any dinner.&rdquo; He
      looked guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Grieg,&rdquo; he protested feebly. &ldquo;Beethoven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to do either,&rdquo; I said with firmness. &ldquo;You are going
      right home to unpack those new draperies that Harry Bayles sent you from
      Shanghai, and you are going to order dinner for eight&mdash;that will be
      two tables of bridge. And you are not going to touch the pianola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem enthusiastic, but he rose and picked up his hat, and stood
      looking down at me where I sat on an old horse-hair covered sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to thunder I had married you!&rdquo; he said savagely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
      finest girl I know, Kit, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, and you are going to throw
      yourself away on Jack Manning, or Max, or some other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I said coldly, &ldquo;and the fact that you didn&rsquo;t marry
      me does not give you the privilege of abusing my friends. Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t
      like you when you speak like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim took me to the door and stopped there to sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been well,&rdquo; he said heavily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat, don&rsquo;t sleep. Wouldn&rsquo;t
      you think I&rsquo;d lose flesh? Kit&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have gained two pounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said he didn&rsquo;t look it, which appeared to comfort him somewhat, and,
      because we were old friends, I asked him where Bella was. He said he
      thought she was in Europe, and that he had heard she was going to marry
      Reggie Wolfe. Then he signed again, muttered something about ordering the
      funeral baked meats to be prepared and left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was my entire share in the affair. I was the victim, both of
      circumstances and of their plot, which was mad on the face of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the entire time they never once let me forget that I got up the
      dinner, that I telephoned around for them. They asked me why I couldn&rsquo;t
      cook&mdash;when not one of them knew one side of a range from the other.
      And for Anne Brown to talk the way she did&mdash;saying I had always been
      crazy about Jim, and that she believed I had known all along that his aunt
      was coming&mdash;for Anne to talk like that was sheer idiocy. Yes, there
      was an aunt. The Japanese butler started the trouble, and Aunt Selina
      carried it along.

    <h2>
      Chapter II. THE WAY IT BEGAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It makes me angry every time I think how I tried to make that dinner a
      success. I canceled a theater engagement, and I took the Mercer girls in
      the electric brougham father had given me for Christmas. Their chauffeur
      had been gone for hours with their machine, and they had telephoned all
      the police stations without success. They were afraid that there had been
      an awful smash; they could easily have replaced Bartlett, as Lollie said,
      but it takes so long to get new parts for those foreign cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim had a house well up-town, and it stood just enough apart from the
      other houses to be entirely maddening later. It was a three-story affair,
      with a basement kitchen and servants&rsquo; dining room. Then, of course, there
      were cellars, as we found out afterward. On the first floor there was a
      large square hall, a formal reception room, behind it a big living room
      that was also a library, then a den, and back of all a Georgian dining
      room, with windows high above the ground. On the top floor Jim had a
      studio, like every other one I ever saw&mdash;perhaps a little mussier.
      Jim was really a grind at his painting, and there were cigarette ashes and
      palette knives and buffalo rugs and shields everywhere. It is strange, but
      when I think of that terrible house, I always see the halls, enormous,
      covered with heavy rugs, and stairs that would have taken six housemaids
      to keep in proper condition. I dream about those stairs, stretching above
      me in a Jacob&rsquo;s ladder of shining wood and Persian carpets, going up, up,
      clear to the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dallas Browns walked; they lived in the next block. And they brought
      with them a man named Harbison, that no one knew. Anne said he would be
      great sport, because he was terribly serious, and had the most exaggerated
      ideas of society, and loathed extravagance, and built bridges or
      something. She had put away her cigarettes since he had been with them&mdash;he
      and Dallas had been college friends&mdash;and the only chance she had to
      smoke was when she was getting her hair done. And she had singed off quite
      a lot&mdash;a burnt offering, she called it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said over the telephone, when I invited her, &ldquo;I want you to
      know him. He&rsquo;ll be crazy about you. That type of man, big and deadly
      earnest, always falls in love with your type of girl, the appealing sort,
      you know. And he has been too busy, up to now, to know what love is. But
      mind, don&rsquo;t hurt him; he&rsquo;s a dear boy. I&rsquo;m half in love with him myself,
      and Dallas trots around at his heels like a poodle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all Anne&rsquo;s geese are swans, so I thought little of the Harbison man
      except to hope that he played respectable bridge, and wouldn&rsquo;t mark the
      cards with a steel spring under his finger nail, as one of her &ldquo;finds&rdquo; had
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all arrived about the same time, and Anne and I went upstairs together
      to take off our wraps in what had been Bella&rsquo;s dressing room. It was Anne
      who noticed the violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; she nudged me, when the maid was examining her wrap before
      she laid it down. &ldquo;What did I tell you, Kit? He&rsquo;s still quite mad about
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim had painted Bella&rsquo;s portrait while they were going up the Nile on
      their wedding trip. It looked quite like her, if you stood well off in the
      middle of the room and if the light came from the right. And just beneath
      it, in a silver vase, was a bunch of violets. It was really touching, and
      violets were fabulous. It made me want to cry, and to shake Bella soundly,
      and to go down and pat Jim on his generous shoulder, and tell him what a
      good fellow I thought him, and that Bella wasn&rsquo;t worth the dust under his
      feet. I don&rsquo;t know much about psychology, but it would be interesting to
      know just what effect those violets and my sympathy for Jim had in
      influencing my decision a half hour later. It is not surprising, under the
      circumstances, that for some time after the odor of violets made me ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all met downstairs in the living room, quite informally, and Dallas was
      banging away at the pianola, tramping the pedals with the delicacy and
      feeling of a football center rush kicking a goal. Mr. Harbison was
      standing near the fire, a little away from the others, and he was all that
      Anne had said and more in appearance. He was tall&mdash;not too tall, and
      very straight. And after one got past the oddity of his face being
      bronze-colored above his white collar, and of his brown hair being
      sun-bleached on top until it was almost yellow, one realized that he was
      very handsome. He had what one might call a resolute nose and chin, and a
      pleasant, rather humorous, mouth. And he had blue eyes that were, at that
      moment, wandering with interest over the lot of us. Somebody shouted his
      name to me above the Tristan and Isolde music, and I held out my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly I had the feeling one sometimes has, of having done just that
      same thing, with the same surroundings, in the same place, years before, I
      was looking up at him, and he was staring down at me and holding my hand.
      And then the music stopped and he was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was what?&rdquo; I asked. The feeling was stronger than ever with his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, and let my hand drop. &ldquo;Just for a second I
      had an idea that we had met before somewhere, a long time ago. I suppose&mdash;no,
      it couldn&rsquo;t have happened, or I should remember.&rdquo; He was smiling, half at
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I smiled back at him. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t happen, I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;unless we
      dreamed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that way, too, for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brushwood Boy!&rdquo; he said with conviction. &ldquo;Perhaps we will find a
      common dream life, where we knew each other. You remember the Brushwood
      Boy loved the girl for years before they really met.&rdquo; But this was a
      little too rapid, even for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so sentimental, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;I have had exactly the
      same sensation sometimes when I have sneezed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty Mercer captured him then and took him off to see Jim&rsquo;s newest
      picture. Anne pounced on me at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he delicious?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Did you ever see such shoulders? And
      such a nose? And he thinks we are parasites, cumberers of the earth,
      Heaven knows what. He says every woman ought to know how to earn her
      living, in case of necessity! I said I could make enough at bridge, and he
      thought I was joking! He&rsquo;s a dear!&rdquo; Anne was enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked after him. Oddly enough the feeling that we had met before stuck
      to me. Which was ridiculous, of course, for we learned afterward that the
      nearest we ever came to meeting was that our mothers had been school
      friends! Just then I saw Jim beckoning to me crazily from the den. He
      looked quite yellow, and he had been running his fingers through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, come in, Kit!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I need a cool head. Didn&rsquo;t I
      tell you this is my calamity day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cook gone?&rdquo; I asked with interest. I was starving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door and took up a tragic attitude in front of the fire.
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Aunt Selina?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew there WAS one,&rdquo; I ventured, mindful of certain gossip as to whence
      Jimmy derived the Wilson income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim himself was too worried to be cautious. He waved a brazen hand at the
      snug room, at the Japanese prints on the walls, at the rugs, at the
      teakwood cabinets and the screen inlaid with pearl and ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this,&rdquo; he said comprehensively, &ldquo;every bite I eat, clothes I wear,
      drinks I drink&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t look like that; I don&rsquo;t drink so darned
      much&mdash;everything comes from Aunt Selina&mdash;buttons,&rdquo; he finished
      with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selina Buttons,&rdquo; I said reflectively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember ever having known
      any one named Buttons, although I had a cat once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the cat!&rdquo; he said rudely. &ldquo;Her name isn&rsquo;t Buttons. Her name is
      Caruthers, my Aunt Selina Caruthers, and the money comes from buttons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old business,&rdquo; he went on, with something of proprietary pride.
      &ldquo;My grandfather founded it in 1775. Made buttons for the Continental
      Army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They melted the buttons to make bullets, didn&rsquo;t they?
      Or they melted bullets to make buttons? Which was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But again he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; he went on hurriedly. &ldquo;Aunt Selina believes in me. She
      likes pictures, and she wanted me to paint, if I could. I&rsquo;d have given up
      long ago&mdash;oh, I know what you think of my work&mdash;but for Aunt
      Selina. She has encouraged me, and she&rsquo;s done more than that; she&rsquo;s paid
      the bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Aunt Selina,&rdquo; I breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I got married,&rdquo; Jim persisted, &ldquo;Aunt Selina doubled my allowance. I
      always expected to sell something, and begin to make money, and in the
      meantime what she advanced I considered as a loan.&rdquo; He was eyeing me
      defiantly, but I was growing serious. It was evident from the preamble
      that something was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To understand, Kit,&rdquo; he went on dubiously, &ldquo;you would have to know her.
      She won&rsquo;t stand for divorce. She thinks it is a crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; I sat up. I have always regarded divorce as essentially
      disagreeable, like castor oil, but necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know well enough what I&rsquo;m driving at,&rdquo; he burst out savagely.
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know Bella has gone. She thinks I am living in a little
      domestic heaven, and&mdash;she is coming tonight to hear me flap my
      wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tonight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t think Jimmy had known that Dallas Brown had come in and was
      listening. I am sure I had not. Hearing his chuckle at the doorway brought
      us up with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where has Aunt Selina been for the last two or three years?&rdquo; he asked
      easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim turned, and his face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Europe. Look here, Dal, you&rsquo;re a smart chap. She&rsquo;ll only be here about
      four hours. Can&rsquo;t you think of some way to get me out of this? I want to
      let her down easy, too. I&rsquo;m mighty fond of Aunt Selina. Can&rsquo;t we&mdash;can&rsquo;t
      I say Bella has a headache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten!&rdquo; laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone out of town?&rdquo; Jim was desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you with a houseful of dinner guests! Try again, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; Jim said suddenly. &ldquo;Dallas, ask Anne if she won&rsquo;t play
      hostess for tonight. Be Mrs. Wilson pro tem. Anne would love it. Aunt
      Selina never saw Bella. Then, afterward, next year, when I&rsquo;m hung in the
      Academy and can stand on my feet&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;Not if you&rsquo;re hung,&rdquo; Dallas
      interjected.)&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break the truth to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dallas was not enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne wouldn&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d be talking about the kids
      before she knew it, and patting me on the head.&rdquo; He said it complacently;
      Anne flirts, but they are really devoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the Mercer girls?&rdquo; I suggested, but Jimmy raised a horrified hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Aunt Selina,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t offer Leila in the
      gown she&rsquo;s got on, unless she wore a shawl, and Betty is too fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne came in just then, and the whole story had to be told again to her.
      She was ecstatic. She said it was good enough for a play, and that of
      course she would be Mrs. Jimmy for that length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;if it were not for Dal, I would be Mrs. Jimmy
      for ANY length of time. I have been devoted to you for years, Billiken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dallas refused peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jealous,&rdquo; he explained, straightening and throwing out his chest,
      &ldquo;but&mdash;well, you don&rsquo;t look the part, Anne. You&rsquo;re&mdash;you are
      growing matronly, not but what you suit ME all right. And then I&rsquo;d forget
      and call you &lsquo;mammy,&rsquo; which would require explanation. I think it&rsquo;s up to
      you, Kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do nothing of the sort!&rdquo; I snapped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare you!&rdquo; said Dallas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I refused. I stood like a rock while the storm surged around me and beat
      over me. I must say for Jim that he was merely pathetic. He said that my
      happiness was first; that he would not give me an uncomfortable minute for
      anything on earth; and that Bella had been perfectly right to leave him,
      because he was a sinking ship, and deserved to be turned out penniless
      into the world. After which mixed figure, he poured himself something to
      drink, and his hands were shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dal and Anne stood on each side of him and patted him on the shoulders and
      glared across at me. I felt that if I was a rock, Jim&rsquo;s ship had struck on
      me and was sinking, as he said, because of me. I began to crumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what time does she leave?&rdquo; I asked, wavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten: nine; KIT, are you going to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; I gave a last clutch at my resolution. &ldquo;People who do that kind of
      thing always get into trouble. She might miss her train. She&rsquo;s almost
      certain to miss her train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re temporizing,&rdquo; Dallas said sternly. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let her miss her
      train; you can be sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; Anne broke in suddenly, &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t she a picture of Bella? There&rsquo;s not
      the faintest resemblance between Bella and Kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim became downcast again. &ldquo;I sent her a miniature of Bella a couple of
      years ago,&rdquo; he said despondently. &ldquo;Did it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dal said he remembered the miniature, and it looked more like me than
      Bella, anyhow. So we were just where we started. And down inside of me I
      had a premonition that I was going to do just what they wanted me to do,
      and get into all sorts of trouble, and not be thanked for it after all.
      Which was entirely correct. And then Leila Mercer came and banged at the
      door and said that dinner had been announced ages ago and that everybody
      was famishing. With the hurry and stress, and poor Jim&rsquo;s distracted face,
      I weakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like a cross between an idiot and a criminal,&rdquo; I said shortly,
      &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know particularly why every one thinks I should be the victim
      for the sacrifice. But if you will promise to get her off early to her
      train, and if you will stand by me and not leave me alone with her, I&mdash;I
      might try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, we&rsquo;ll stand by you!&rdquo; they said in chorus. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let you
      stick!&rdquo; And Dal said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the right sort of girl, Kit. And after it&rsquo;s
      all over, you&rsquo;ll realize that it&rsquo;s the biggest kind of lark. Think how you
      are saving the old lady&rsquo;s feeling! When you are an elderly person
      yourself, Kit, you will appreciate what you are doing tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they said they would stand by me, and that I was a heroine and the
      only person there clever enough to act the part, and that they wouldn&rsquo;t
      let me stick! I am not bitter now, but that is what they promised. Oh, I
      am not defending myself; I suppose I deserved everything that happened.
      But they told me that she would be there only between trains, and that she
      was deaf, and that I had an opportunity to save a fellow-being from ruin.
      So in the end I capitulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they opened the door into the living room, Max Reed had arrived and
      was helping to hide a decanter and glasses, and somebody said a cab was at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was the way it began.

    <h2>
      Chapter III. I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The minute I had consented I regretted it. After all, what were Jimmy&rsquo;s
      troubles to me? Why should I help him impose on an unsuspecting elderly
      woman? And it was only putting off discovery anyhow. Sooner or later, she
      would learn of the divorce, and&mdash;Just at that instant my eyes fell on
      Mr. Harbison&mdash;Tom Harbison, as Anne called him. He was looking on
      with an amused, half-puzzled smile, while people were rushing around
      hiding the roulette wheel and things of which Miss Caruthers might
      disapprove, and Betty Mercer was on her knees winding up a toy bear that
      Max had brought her. What would he think? It was evident that he thought
      badly of us already&mdash;that he was contemptuously amused, and then to
      have to ask him to lend himself to the deception!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a gasp I hurled myself after Jimmy, only to hear a strange voice in
      the hall and to know that I was too late. I was in for it, whatever was
      coming. It was Aunt Selina who was coming&mdash;along the hall, followed
      by Jim, who was mopping his face and trying not to notice the paralyzed
      silence in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina met me in the doorway. To my frantic eyes she seemed to tower
      above us by at least a foot, and beside her Jimmy was a red, perspiring
      cherub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is,&rdquo; Jimmy said, from behind a temporary eclipse of black cloak
      and traveling bag. He was on top of the situation now, and he was
      mendaciously cheerful. He had NOT said, &ldquo;Here is my wife.&rdquo; That would have
      been a lie. No, Jimmy merely said, &ldquo;Here she is.&rdquo; If Aunt Selina chose to
      think me Bella, was it not her responsibility? And if I chose to accept
      the situation, was it not mine? Dallas Brown came forward gravely as Aunt
      Selina folded over and kissed me, and surreptitiously patted me with one
      hand while he held out the other to Miss Caruthers. I loathed him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We always expect something unusual from James, Miss Caruthers,&rdquo; he said,
      with his best manner, &ldquo;but THIS&mdash;this is beyond our wildest dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, it&rsquo;s too awful to linger over. Anne took her upstairs and into
      Bella&rsquo;s bedroom. It was a fancy of Jim&rsquo;s to leave that room just as Bella
      had left it, dusty dance cards and favors hanging around and a pair of
      discarded slippers under the bed. I don&rsquo;t think it had been swept since
      Bella left it. I believe in sentiment, but I like it brushed and dusted
      and the cobwebs off of it, and when Aunt Selina put down her bonnet, it
      stirred up a gray-white cloud that made her cough. She did not say
      anything, but she looked around the room grimly, and I saw her run her
      finger over the back of a chair before she let Hannah, the maid, put her
      cloak on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked frightened. She ran into Bella&rsquo;s bath and wet the end of a
      towel and when Hannah was changing Aunt Selina&rsquo;s collar&mdash;her
      concession to evening dress&mdash;Anne wiped off the obvious places on the
      furniture. She did it stealthily, but Aunt Selina saw her in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that young woman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; she asked me sharply, when Anne had
      taken the towel out to hide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Brown, Mrs. Dallas Brown,&rdquo; I replied meekly. Every one replied
      meekly to Aunt Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she live here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I said airily. &ldquo;They are here to dinner, she and her husband.
      They are old friends of Jim&rsquo;s&mdash;and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to have a good eye for dirt,&rdquo; said Aunt Selina and went on
      fastening her brooch. When she was finally ready, she took a bead purse
      from somewhere about her waist and took out a half dollar. She held it up
      before Hannah&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow morning,&rdquo; she said sternly, &ldquo;You take off that white cap and
      that fol-de-rol apron and that black henrietta cloth, and put on a calico
      wrapper. And when you&rsquo;ve got this room aired and swept, Mrs. Wilson will
      give you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannah took two steps back and caught hold of a chair; she stared
      helplessly from Aunt Selina to the half dollar, and then at me. Anne was
      trying not to catch my eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing,&rdquo; Aunt Selina said, from the head of the stairs, &ldquo;I
      sent those towels over from Ireland. Tell her to wash and bleach the one
      Mrs. What&rsquo;s-her-name Brown used as a duster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne was quite crushed as we went down the stairs. I turned once, half-way
      down, and her face was a curious mixture of guilt and hopeless wrath. Over
      her shoulder, I could see Hannah, wide-eyed and puzzled, staring after us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim presented everybody, and then he went into the den and closed the door
      and we heard him unlock the cellarette. Aunt Selina looked at Leila&rsquo;s bare
      shoulders and said she guessed she didn&rsquo;t take cold easily, and
      conversation rather languished. Max Reed was looking like a thundercloud,
      and he came over to me with a lowering expression that I had learned to
      dread in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fool nonsense is this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What in the world possessed
      you, Kit, to put yourself in such an equivocal position? Unless&rdquo;&mdash;he
      stopped and turned a little white&mdash;&ldquo;unless you are going to marry
      Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry for Max. He is such a nice boy, and good looking, too, if only
      he were not so fierce, and did not want to make love to me. No matter what
      I do, Max always disapproves of it. I have always had a deeply rooted
      conviction that if I should ever in a weak moment marry Max, he would
      disapprove of that, too, before I had done it very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; he demanded, narrowing his eyes&mdash;a sign of unusually bad
      humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Jim,&rdquo; I said with dignity, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind yet.
      Besides, he hasn&rsquo;t asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina had been talking Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage in front of the fireplace,
      but now she turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the vase Cousin Jane Whitcomb sent you as a wedding present?&rdquo; she
      demanded, indicating a hideous urn-shaped affair on the mantel. It came to
      me as an inspiration that Jim had once said it was an ancestral urn, so I
      said without hesitation that it was. And because there was a pause and
      every one was looking at us, I added that it was a beautiful thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hideous!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It looks like Cousin Jane, shape and coloring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she looked at it more closely, pounced on it, turned it upside down
      and shook it. A card fell out, which Dallas picked up and gave her with a
      bow. Jim had come out of the den and was dancing wildly around and
      beckoning to me. By the time I had made out that that was NOT the vase
      Cousin Jane had sent us as a wedding present, Aunt Selina had examined the
      card. Then she glared across at me and, stooping, put the card in the
      fire. I did not understand at all, but I knew I had in some way done the
      unforgivable thing. Later, Dal told me it was HER card, and that she had
      sent the vase to Jim at Christmas, with a generous check inside. When she
      straightened from the fireplace, it was to a new theme, which she attacked
      with her usual vigor. The vase incident was over, but she never forgot it.
      She proved that she never did when she sent me two urn-shaped vases with
      Paul and Virginia on them, when I&mdash;that is, later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cause in England has made great strides,&rdquo; she announced from the
      fireplace. &ldquo;Soon the hand that rocks the cradle will be the hand that
      actually rules the world.&rdquo; Here she looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not up on such things,&rdquo; Max said blandly, having recovered some of
      his good humor, &ldquo;but&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it usually a foot that rocks the cradle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina turned on him and Mr. Harbison, who were standing together,
      with a snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you, or YOU, ever done for the independence of woman?&rdquo; she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison smiled. He had been looking rather grave until then. &ldquo;We have
      at least remained unmarried,&rdquo; he retorted. And then dinner was again
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to take me out, and he came across the room to where I sat
      collapsed in a chair, and bent over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, looking down at me with his clear, disconcerting
      gaze, &ldquo;do you know that I have just grasped the situation? There was such
      a noise that I did not hear your name, and I am only realizing now that
      you are my hostess! I don&rsquo;t know why I got the impression that this was a
      bachelor establishment, but I did. Odd, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I positively couldn&rsquo;t look away from him. My features seemed frozen, and
      my eyes were glued to his. As for telling him the truth&mdash;well, my
      tongue refused to move. I intended to tell him during dinner if I had an
      opportunity; I honestly did. But the more I looked at him and saw how
      candid his eyes were, and how stern his mouth might be, the more I
      shivered at the plunge. And, of course, as everybody knows now, I didn&rsquo;t
      tell him at all. And every moment I expected that awful old woman to ask
      me what I paid my cook, and when I had changed the color of my hair&mdash;Bella&rsquo;s
      being black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was a half hour late when we finally went out, Jimmy leading off
      with Aunt Selina, and I, as hostess, trailing behind the procession with
      Mr. Harbison. Dallas took in the two Mercer girls, for we were one man
      short, and Max took Anne. Leila Mercer was so excited that she wriggled,
      and as for me, the candles and the orchids&mdash;everything&mdash;danced
      around in a circle, and I just seemed to catch the back of my chair as it
      flew past. Jim had ordered away the wines and brought out some weak and
      cheap Chianti. Dallas looked gloomy at the change, but Jim explained in an
      undertone that Aunt Selina didn&rsquo;t approve of expensive vintages.
      Naturally, the meal was glum enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina had had her dinner on the train, so she spent her time in
      asking me questions the length of the table, and in getting acquainted
      with me. She had brought a bottle of some sort of medicine downstairs with
      her, and she took a claret-glassful, while she talked. The stuff was
      called Pomona; shall I ever forget it?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Harbison who first noticed Takahiro. Jimmy&rsquo;s Jap had been the
      only thing in the menage that Bella declared she had hated to leave. But
      he was doing the strangest things: his little black eyes shifted
      nervously, and he looked queer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with him?&rdquo; Mr. Harbison asked me finally, when he saw that I
      noticed. &ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Aunt Selina&rsquo;s voice from the other end of the table:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella,&rdquo; she called, in a high shrill tone, &ldquo;do you let James eat
      cucumbers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he must be,&rdquo; I said hurriedly aside to Mr. Harbison. &ldquo;See how his
      hands shake!&rdquo; But Selina would not be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cucumbers and strawberries,&rdquo; she repeated impressively. &ldquo;I was saying,
      Bella, that cucumbers have always given James the most fearful
      indigestion. And yet I see you serve them at your table. Do you remember
      what I wrote you to give him when he has his dreadful spells?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was quite speechless; every one was looking, and no one could help. It
      was clear Jim was racking his brain, and we sat staring desperately at
      each other across the candles. Everything I had ever known faded from me,
      eight pairs of eyes bored into me, Mr. Harbison&rsquo;s politely amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; I said at last. &ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&rdquo; Aunt
      Selina smiled in a superior way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you recall it?&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;I said: &lsquo;Baking soda in water
      taken internally for cucumbers; baking soda and water externally, rubbed
      on, when he gets that dreadful, itching strawberry rash.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I believe the dinner went on. Somebody asked Aunt Selina how much
      over-charge she had paid in foreign hotels, and after that she was as
      harmless as a dove.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then half way through the dinner we heard a crash in Takahiro&rsquo;s pantry,
      and when he did not appear again, Jim got up and went out to investigate.
      He was gone quite a little while, and when he came back he looked worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick,&rdquo; he replied to our inquiring glances. &ldquo;One of the maids will come
      in. They have sent for a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina was for going out at once and &ldquo;fixing him up,&rdquo; as she put it,
      but Dallas gently interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, Miss Caruthers,&rdquo; he said, in the deferential manner he had
      adopted toward her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it may be. He&rsquo;s been looking
      spotty all evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be scarlet fever,&rdquo; Max broke in cheerfully. &ldquo;I say, scarlet
      fever on a Mongolian&mdash;what color would he be, Jimmy? What do yellow
      and red make? Green?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orange,&rdquo; Jim said shortly. &ldquo;I wish you people would remember that we are
      trying to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, however, that no one was really eating, except Mr. Harbison
      who had given up trying to understand us, considering, no doubt, our
      subdued excitement as our normal condition. Ages afterward I learned that
      he thought my face almost tragic that night, and that he supposed from the
      way I glared across the table, that I had quarreled with my husband!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are not well,&rdquo; he said at last, noticing my food
      untouched on my plate. &ldquo;We should not have come, any of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly well,&rdquo; I replied feverishly. &ldquo;I am never ill. I&mdash;I
      ate a late luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me keenly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them stay and play bridge tonight,&rdquo; he
      urged. &ldquo;Miss Caruthers can be an excuse, can she not? And you are really
      fagged. You look it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is only ill humor,&rdquo; I said, looking directly at him. &ldquo;I am
      angry at myself. I have done something silly, and I hate to be silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max would have said &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; or something else trite. The Harbison
      man looked at me with interested, serious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it too late to undo it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then and there I determined that he should never know the truth. He
      could go back to South America and build bridges and make love to the
      Spanish girls (or are they Spanish down there?) and think of me always as
      a married woman, married to a dilettante artist, inclined to be stout&mdash;the
      artist, not I&mdash;and with an Aunt Selina Caruthers who made buttons and
      believed in the Cause. But never, NEVER should he think of me as a silly
      little fool who pretended that she was the other man&rsquo;s wife and had a lump
      in her throat because when a really nice man came along, a man who knew
      something more than polo and motors, she had to carry on the deception to
      keep his respect, and be sedate and matronly, and see him change from
      perfect open admiration at first to a hands-off-she-is-my-host&rsquo;s-wife
      attitude at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can never be undone,&rdquo; I said soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that&rsquo;s the picture as nearly as I can draw it: a round table with a
      low centerpiece of orchids in lavenders and pink, old silver candlesticks
      with filigree shades against the somber wainscoting; nine people, two of
      them unhappy&mdash;Jim and I; one of them complacent&mdash;Aunt Selina;
      one puzzled&mdash;Mr. Harbison; and the rest hysterically mirthful. Add
      one sick Japanese butler and grind in the mills of the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one promptly forgot Takahiro in the excitement of the game we were
      all playing. Finally, however, Aunt Selina, who seemed to have Takahiro on
      her mind, looked up from her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Jap was speckled,&rdquo; she asserted. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it&rsquo;s
      measles. Has he been sniffling, James?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been sniffling?&rdquo; Jim threw across at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it,&rdquo; I said meekly, while the others choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max came to the rescue. &ldquo;She refused to eat it,&rdquo; he explained, distinctly
      and to everybody, apropos absolutely of nothing. &ldquo;It said on the
      box, &lsquo;ready cooked and predigested.&rsquo; She declared she didn&rsquo;t care who
      cooked it, but she wanted to know who predigested it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As every one wanted to laugh, every one did it then, and under cover of
      the noise I caught Anne&rsquo;s eye, and we left the dining room. The men
      stayed, and by the very firmness with which the door closed behind us, I
      knew that Dallas and Max were bringing out the bottles that Takahiro had
      hidden. I was seething. When Aunt Selina indicated a desire to go over the
      house (it was natural that she should want to; it was her house, in a way)
      I excused myself for a minute and flew back to the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as I had expected. Jim hadn&rsquo;t cheered perceptibly, and the rest
      were patting him on the back, and pouring things out for him, and saying,
      &ldquo;Poor old Jim&rdquo; in the most maddening way. And the Harbison man was looking
      more and more puzzled, and not at all hilarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I descended on them like a thunderbolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; I cried shrewishly, with my back against the door. &ldquo;Leave her
      to me, all of you, and pat each other on the back, and say it&rsquo;s gone
      splendidly! Oh, I know you, every one!&rdquo; Mr. Harbison got up and pulled out
      a chair, but I couldn&rsquo;t sit; I folded my arms on the back. &ldquo;After a while,
      I suppose, you&rsquo;ll slip upstairs, the four of you, and have your game.&rdquo;
       They looked guilty. &ldquo;But I will block that right now. I am going to stay&mdash;here.
      If Aunt Selina wants me, she can find me&mdash;here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first indication those men had that Mr. Harbison didn&rsquo;t know the state
      of affairs was when he turned and faced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilson is quite right,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a selfish lot. If
      Miss Caruthers is a responsibility, let us share her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; Jim said, with an affectation of lightness, as they put their
      glasses down, and threw open the door. Dal&rsquo;s retort, &ldquo;Whose?&rdquo; was lost in
      the confusion, and we went into the library. On the way Dallas managed to
      speak to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Harbison doesn&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t tell him,&rdquo; he said in an undertone. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      a queer duck, in some ways; he mightn&rsquo;t think it funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; I choked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least funny thing I ever experienced.
      Deceiving that Harbison man isn&rsquo;t so bad&mdash;he thinks me crazy, anyhow.
      He&rsquo;s been staring his eyes out at me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder. You&rsquo;re really lovely tonight, Kit, and you look like a
      vixen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to deceive that harmless old lady&mdash;well, thank goodness, it&rsquo;s
      nine, and she leaves in an hour or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she didn&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s the story.

      Chapter IV. THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was infuriating to see how much enjoyment every one but Jim and myself
      got out of the situation. They howled with mirth over the feeblest jokes,
      and when Max told a story without any point whatever, they all had
      hysteria. Immediately after dinner Aunt Selina had begun on the family
      connection again, and after two bad breaks on my part, Jim offered to show
      her the house. The Mercer girls trailed along, unwilling to lose any of
      the possibilities. They said afterward that it was terrible: she went into
      all the closets, and ran her hand over the tops of doors and kept getting
      grimmer and grimmer. In the studio they came across a life study Jim was
      doing and she shut her eyes and made the girls go out while he covered it
      with a drapery. Lollie! Who did the Bacchante dance at three benefits last
      winter and was learning a new one called &ldquo;Eve&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      When they heard Aunt Selina on the second floor, Anne, Dal and Max sneaked
      up to the studio for cigarettes, which left Mr. Harbison to me. I was in
      the den, sitting in a low chair by the wood fire when he came in. He
      hesitated in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you prefer being alone, or may I come in?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind
      being frank. I know you are tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a headache, and I am sulking,&rdquo; I said unpleasantly, &ldquo;but at least
      I am not actively venomous. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he came in and sat down across the hearth from me, and neither of us
      said anything. The firelight flickered over the room, bringing out the
      faded hues of the old Japanese prints on the walls, gleaming in the
      mother-of-pearl eyes of the dragon on the screen, setting a grotesque god
      on a cabinet to nodding. And it threw into relief the strong profile of
      the man across from me, as he stared at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I am not very interesting,&rdquo; I said at last, when he showed no
      sign of breaking the silence. &ldquo;The&mdash;the illness of the butler and&mdash;Miss
      Caruthers&rsquo; arrival, have been upsetting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly roused with a start from a brown reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&mdash;oh, of course not! I was wondering
      if I&mdash;if you were offended at what I said earlier in the evening; the&mdash;Brushwood
      Boy, you know, and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offended?&rdquo; I repeated, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I have been living out of the world so long, and never seeing
      any women but Indian squaws&rdquo;&mdash;so there were no Spanish girls!&mdash;&ldquo;that
      I&rsquo;m afraid I say what comes into my mind without circumlocution. And then&mdash;I
      did not know you were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, oh, no,&rdquo; I said hastily. &ldquo;But, of course, the more a woman is married&mdash;I
      mean, you can not say too many nice things to married women. They&mdash;need
      them, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had floundered miserably, with his eyes on me, and I half expected him
      to be shocked, or to say that married women should be satisfied with the
      nice things their husbands say to them. But he merely remarked apropos of
      nothing, or following a line of thought he had not voiced, that it was
      trite but true that a good many men owed their success in life to their
      wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a good many owe their wives to their success in life,&rdquo; I retorted
      cynically. At which he stared at me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the real complexity of the situation began to develop.
      Some one had rung the bell and been admitted to the library and a maid
      came to the door of the den. When she saw us she stopped uncertainly. Even
      then it struck me that she looked odd, and she was not in uniform.
      However, I was not informed at that time about bachelor establishments,
      and the first thing she said, when she had asked to speak to me in the
      hall, knocked her and her clothes clear out of my head. Evidently she knew
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McNair,&rdquo; she said in a low tone. &ldquo;There is a lady in the drawing
      room, a veiled person, and she is asking for Mr. Wilson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not find him?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;He is in the house, probably in the
      studio.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, miss, but Miss Caruthers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Close the door into the drawing room, and I will
      tell Mr. Wilson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as the girl turned toward the doorway, the person in question appeared
      in it, and raised her veil. I was perfectly paralyzed. It was Bella! Bella
      in a fur coat and a veil, with the most tragic eyes I ever saw and
      entirely white except for a dab of rouge in the middle of each cheek. We
      stared at each other without speech. The maid turned and went down the
      hall, and with that Bella came over to me and clutched me by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was being carried out into that ambulance?&rdquo; she demanded, glaring at
      me with the most awful intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, Bella,&rdquo; I said, wriggling away from her fingers.
      &ldquo;What in the world are you doing here? I thought you were in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hiding something from me!&rdquo; she accused. &ldquo;It is Jim! I see it in
      your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I snapped. &ldquo;It seems to me, really, Bella, that you and
      Jim ought to be able to manage your own affairs, without dragging me in.&rdquo;
       It was not pleasant, but if she was suffering, so was I. &ldquo;Jim is as well
      as he ever was. He&rsquo;s upstairs somewhere. I&rsquo;ll send for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gripped me again, and held on while her color came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; she said, and she had quite got hold of
      herself again. &ldquo;I do not want to see him: I hope you don&rsquo;t think, Kit,
      that I came here to see James Wilson. Why, I have forgotten that there IS
      such a person, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody upstairs laughed, and I was growing nervous. What if Aunt Selina
      should come down, or Mr. Harbison come out of the den?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why DID you come, then, Bella?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;He may come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was passing in the motor,&rdquo; she said, and I honestly think she hoped I
      would believe her, &ldquo;and I saw that am&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped and began again.
      &ldquo;I thought Jim was out of town, and I came to see Takahiro,&rdquo; she said
      brazenly. &ldquo;He was devoted to me, and Evans is going to leave. I&rsquo;ll tell
      you what to do, Kit. I&rsquo;ll go back to the dining room, and you send Taka
      there. If any one comes, I can slip into the pantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s immoral,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s immoral to steal your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own butler!&rdquo; she broke in impatiently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not usually so
      scrupulous, Kit. Hurry! I hear that hateful Anne Brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we slid back along the hall, and I rang for Takahiro. But no one came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I ought to tell you, Bella,&rdquo; I said as we waited, and Bella was
      staring around the room&mdash;&ldquo;I think you ought to know that Miss
      Caruthers is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank goodness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to see her. The only
      pleasant thing I remember about my year of married life is that I did NOT
      meet Aunt Selina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rang again, but still there was no answer. And then it occurred to me
      that the stillness below stairs was almost oppressive. Bella was noticing
      things, too, for she began to fasten her veil again with a malicious
      little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the things I remember my late husband saying,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;was
      that HE could manage this house, and had done it for years, with flawless
      service. Stand on the bell, Kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did. We stood there, with the table, just as it had been left, between
      us, and waited for a response. Bella was growing impatient. She raised her
      eyebrows (she is very handsome, Bella is) and flung out her chin as if she
      had begun to enjoy the horrible situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I heard a rattle of silver from the pantry just then, and I
      hurried to the door in a rage. But the pantry was empty of servants and
      full of dishes, and all the lights were out but one, which was burning
      dimly. I could have sworn that I saw one of the servants duck into the
      stairway to the basement, but when I got there the stairs were empty, and
      something was burning in the kitchen below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella had followed me and was peering over my shoulder curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a servant in the house,&rdquo; she said triumphantly. And when we
      went down to the kitchen, she seemed to be right. It was in disgraceful
      order, and one of the bottles of wine that had ben banished from the
      dining room sat half empty on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drunk!&rdquo; Bella said with conviction. But I didn&rsquo;t think so. There had not
      been time enough, for one thing. Suddenly I remembered the ambulance that
      had been the cause of Bella&rsquo;s appearance&mdash;for no one could believe
      her silly story about Takahiro. I didn&rsquo;t wait to voice my suspicion to
      her; I simply left her there, staring helplessly at the confusion, and ran
      upstairs again: through the dining room, past Jimmy and Aunt Selina, past
      Leila Mercer and Max, who were flirting on the stairs, up, up to the
      servants&rsquo; bedrooms, and there my suspicions were verified. There was every
      evidence of a hasty flight; in three bedrooms five trunks stood locked and
      ominous, and the closets yawned with open doors, empty. Bella had been
      right; there was not a servant in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I emerged from the untidy emptiness of the servants&rsquo; wing, I met Mr.
      Harbison coming out of the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would let me do some of this running about for you, Mrs.
      Wilson,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;You are not well, and I can&rsquo;t think of anything
      worse for a headache. Has the butler&rsquo;s illness clogged the household
      machinery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; I replied, trying not to breathe in gasps. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be running
      around&mdash;like this&mdash;but there is not a servant in the house! They
      have gone, the entire lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Gone! Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In reply I pointed to the servants&rsquo; wing. &ldquo;Trunks packed,&rdquo; I said
      tragically, &ldquo;rooms empty, kitchen and pantries, full of dishes. Did you
      ever hear of anything like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;It makes me suspect&mdash;&rdquo; What he suspected he
      did not say; instead he turned on his heel, without a word of explanation,
      and ran down the stairs. I stood staring after him, wondering if every one
      in the place had gone crazy. Then I heard Betty Mercer scream and the rest
      talking loud and laughing, and Mr. Harbison came up the stairs again two
      at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has that Jap been ailing, Mrs. Wilson?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I replied helplessly. &ldquo;What is the trouble,
      anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he probably has something contagious,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it has
      scared the servants away. As Mr. Brown said, he looked spotty. I suggested
      to your husband that it might be as well to get the house emptied&mdash;in
      case we are correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, by all means,&rdquo; I said eagerly. I couldn&rsquo;t get away too soon.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get my&mdash;&rdquo; Then I stopped. Why, the man wouldn&rsquo;t expect
      me to leave; I would have to play out the wretched farce to the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down and see them off,&rdquo; I finished lamely, and we went together
      down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just for the moment I forgot Bella altogether. I found Aunt Selina
      bonneted and cloaked, taking a stirrup cup of Pomona for her nerves, and
      the rest throwing on their wraps in a hurry. Downstairs Max was
      telephoning for his car, which wasn&rsquo;t due for an hour, and Jim was walking
      up and down, swearing under his breath. With the prospect of getting rid
      of them all, and, of going home comfortably to try to forget the whole
      wretched affair, I cheered up quite a lot. I even played up my part of
      hostess, and Dallas told me, aside, that I was a brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Jim threw open the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a man on the top step, with his mouth full of tacks, and he was
      nailing something to the door, just below Jim&rsquo;s Florentine bronze knocker,
      and standing back with his head on one side to see if it was straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Jim demanded fiercely, but the man only drove
      another tack. It was Mr. Harbison who stepped outside and read the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      It said &ldquo;Smallpox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smallpox,&rdquo; Mr. Harbison read, as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Then he
      turned to us, huddled in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems it wasn&rsquo;t measles, after all,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;I move we
      get into Mr. Reed&rsquo;s automobile out there, and have a vaccination party. I
      suppose even you blase society folk have not exhausted that kind of
      diversion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the man on the step spat his tacks in his hand and spoke for the first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not on your life. Just step back, please, and
      close the door. This house is quarantined.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter V. FROM THE TREE OF LOVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is hardly any use trying to describe what followed. Anne Brown began
      to cry, and talk about the children. (She went to Europe once and stayed
      until they all got over the whooping cough.) And Dallas said he had a
      pull, because his mill controlled I forget how many votes, and the thing
      to do was to be quiet and comfortable and we would get out in the morning.
      Max took it as a huge joke, and somebody found him at the telephone,
      calling up his club. The Mercer girls were hysterically giggling, and Aunt
      Selina sat on a stiff-backed chair and took aromatic spirits of ammonia.
      As for Jim, he had collapsed on the lowest step of the stairs, and sat
      there with his head in his hands. When he did look up, he didn&rsquo;t dare to
      look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Harbison man was arguing with the impassive individual on the top step
      outside, and I saw him get out his pocketbook and offer a crisp bundle of
      bills. But the man from the board of health only smiled and tacked at his
      offensive sign. After a while Mr. Harbison came in and closed the door,
      and we stared at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; I said, swallowing a lump in my throat.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get out through a basement window at the back. I&rsquo;m going
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home!&rdquo; Aunt Selina gasped, jumping up and almost dropping her ammonia
      bottle. &ldquo;My dear Bella! Home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy groaned at the foot of the stairs, but Anne Brown was getting over
      her tears and now she turned on me in a temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your fault,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was going to stay at home and get a
      little sleep&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can sleep now,&rdquo; Dallas broke in. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be nothing to do but
      sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you haven&rsquo;t grasped the situation, Dal,&rdquo; I said icily. &ldquo;There
      will be plenty to do. There isn&rsquo;t a servant in the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No servants!&rdquo; everybody cried at once. The Mercer girls stopped giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy cats!&rdquo; Max stopped in the act of hanging up his overcoat. &ldquo;Do you
      mean&mdash;why, I can&rsquo;t shave myself! I&rsquo;ll cut my head off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do more than that,&rdquo; I retorted grimly. &ldquo;You will carry coal and
      tend fires and empty ash pans, and when you are not doing any of those
      things there will be pots and pans to wash and beds to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there WAS a row. We had worked back to the den now, and I stood in
      front of the fireplace and let the storm beat around me, and tried to look
      perfectly cold and indifferent, and not to see Mr. Harbison&rsquo;s shocked
      face. No wonder he thought them a lot of savages, browbeating their
      hostess the way they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fool thing anyhow,&rdquo; Max Reed wound up, &ldquo;to celebrate the
      anniversary of a divorce&mdash;especially&mdash;&rdquo; Here he caught Jim&rsquo;s eye
      and stopped. But I had suddenly remembered. BELLA DOWN IN THE BASEMENT!
    </p>
    <p>
      Could anything have been worse? And of course she would have hysteria and
      then turn on me and blame me for it all. It all came over me at once and
      overwhelmed me, while Anne was crying and saying she wouldn&rsquo;t cook if she
      starved for it, and Aunt Selina was taking off her wraps. I felt queer all
      over, and I sat down suddenly. Mr. Harbison was looking at me, and he
      brought me a glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be so bad as you fear,&rdquo; he said comfortingly. &ldquo;There will be no
      danger once we are vaccinated, and many hands make light work. They are
      pretty raw now, because the thing is new to them, but by morning they will
      be reconciled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the work; it is something entirely different,&rdquo; I said. And it
      was. Bella and work could hardly be spoken in the same breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had only turned her out as she deserved to be, when she first came,
      instead of allowing her to carry through the wretched farce about seeing
      Takahiro! Or if I had only run to the basement the moment the house was
      quarantined, and got her out the areaway or the coal hole! And now time
      was flying, and Aunt Selina had me by the arm, and any moment I expected
      Bella to pounce on us through the doorway and the whole situation to
      explode with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after eleven before they were rational enough to discuss ways and
      means, and, of course, the first thing suggested was that we all adjourn
      below stairs and clean up after dinner. I could have slain Max Reed for
      the notion, and the Mercer girls for taking him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we will,&rdquo; they said in a duet. &ldquo;What a lark!&rdquo; And they actually
      began to pin up their dinner gowns. It was Jim who stopped that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look here, you people,&rdquo; he objected, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you do
      that. We&rsquo;ll get some servants in tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll go down and put out the
      lights. There will be enough clean dishes for breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was lucky for me that they started a new discussion then and there
      about who would get the breakfast. In the midst of the excitement I
      slipped away to carry the news to Bella. She was where I had left her, and
      she had made herself a cup of tea, and was very much at home, which was
      natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said ominously, &ldquo;that you have been away for two hours;
      and that I have gone through agonies of nervousness for fear Jim Wilson
      would come down and think I came here to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one would think that, Bella,&rdquo; I soothed her. &ldquo;Everybody knows you
      loathe him&mdash;Jim, too.&rdquo; She looked at me over the edge of her cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run along now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;since Takahiro isn&rsquo;t here. And if Jim has
      any sense at all, he will clear out every maid in the house. I never saw
      such a kitchen in all my life. Well, lead the way, Kit. I suppose they are
      deep in bridge, or roulette, or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was fixing her veil, and I saw I would have to tell her. Personally, I
      would much rather have told her the house was on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, Bella,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You see, something queer has happened.
      You know this is the anniversary&mdash;well, you know what it is&mdash;and
      Jim was awfully glum. So we thought we would come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You are sea-green, Kit. What&rsquo;s
      the matter? You needn&rsquo;t think I mind because Jim has a jollification to
      celebrate his divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it was Takahiro&mdash;in the ambulance,&rdquo; I blurted. &ldquo;Smallpox.
      We&mdash;Bella, we are shut in, quarantined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t faint. She just sat down and stared at me, and I stared back at
      her. Then a miserable alarm clock on the table suddenly went off like an
      explosion, and Bella began to laugh. I knew what that was&mdash;hysteria.
      She always had attacks like that when things went wrong. I was quite
      despairing by that time; I hoped they would all hear her and come
      downstairs and take her up and put her to bed like a Christian, so she
      could giggle her soul out. But after a bit she quieted down and began to
      cry softly, and I knew the worst was over. I gave her a shake, and she was
      so angry that she got over it altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kit, you are horrid,&rdquo; she choked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what a position I am in?
      I am not going upstairs to face Anne and the rest of them. You can just
      put me in the coal cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a window you could get through?&rdquo; I asked desperately.
      &ldquo;Locking the door doesn&rsquo;t shut up a whole house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella&rsquo;s courage revived at that, and she said yes, there were windows,
      plenty of them, only she didn&rsquo;t see how she could get out. And I said she
      would HAVE to get out, because I was playing Bella in the performance, and
      I didn&rsquo;t care to have an understudy. Then the situation dawned on her, and
      she sat down and laughed herself weak in the knees. Of course she wanted
      to stay, then, and see the fun out. But I was firm; she would have to go,
      and I told her so. Things were complicated enough without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we looked funny, no doubt, Bella in a Russian pony automobile coat
      over the black satin she had worn at the Clevelands&rsquo; dinner, and I in
      cream lace, the skirt gathered up from the kitchen floor, with Bella&rsquo;s
      ermine pelerine around my bare shoulders, and dishes and overturned chairs
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella knew more about the lower regions of her ex-home than I would have
      thought. She opened a door in a corner and led the way through a narrow
      hall past the refrigerating room, to a huge, cemented cellar, with a
      furnace in the center, and a half-dozen electric lights making it really
      brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a chair,&rdquo; Bella said over her shoulder, excitedly. &ldquo;I can get out
      easily here, through the coal hole. Imagine my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was my turn to grip Bella. From behind the furnace were coming the
      most terrible sounds, rasping noises that fairly frayed the silk of my
      nerves. We stood petrified for an instant. Then Bella laughed. &ldquo;They are
      not all gone,&rdquo; she said carefully. &ldquo;Some one is asleep there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We tiptoed to where we could see around the furnace, and, sure enough,
      some one WAS asleep there. Only, it was not one of the servants; it was a
      portly policeman, with a newspaper and an empty plate on the floor on one
      side, and a champagne bottle on the other. He had slid down in his chair,
      with his chin on his brass buttons, and his helmet had rolled a dozen feet
      away. Bella had to clap her hand over her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly caught!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Sartor Resartus, the arrester arrested.
      Oh, Jim and his flawless service!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But after we got over our surprise, we saw the situation was serious. The
      policeman was threatening to awaken. Once he stopped snoring to yawn
      noisily, and we beat a hasty retreat. Bella switched off the lights in a
      hurry and locked the door behind us. We hardly breathed until we were back
      in the kitchen again, and everything quiet. And then Jimmy called my name
      from up above somewheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to call him down, Bella,&rdquo; I said firmly. &ldquo;Let him help you
      out. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t see why I should have all this when the two of you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no! Surely, Kit, you wouldn&rsquo;t be so cruel!&rdquo; she whispered
      pleadingly. &ldquo;You know what he would think. He&mdash;oh, Kit, let them all
      get settled for the night, and then come down, like a dear, and help me
      out. I know loads of ways&mdash;honestly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I leave you here,&rdquo; I debated, &ldquo;what about the policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him&rdquo;&mdash;frantically. &ldquo;Listen! There&rsquo;s Jim up in the pantry.
      Run, for the sake of Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So&mdash;I ran. At the top of the stairs I met Jimmy, very crumpled as to
      shirt-front and dejected as to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hunting everywhere for you,&rdquo; he said dismally. &ldquo;I thought you
      had added to the general merriment by falling downstairs and breaking your
      neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went past him with my chin up. Now that I had time to think about it, I
      was furiously angry with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kit!&rdquo; he called after me appealingly, but I would not hear. Then he
      adopted different tactics. He took advantage of my catching my foot in the
      lace of my gown to pass me, and to stand with his back against the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going until you hear me, Kit,&rdquo; he declared miserably. &ldquo;In the
      first place, for all you are down on me, is it my fault? Honestly, now IS
      IT MY FAULT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I refused to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming home to be miserable alone,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and&mdash;oh, I
      know you meant well, Kit; but YOU asked all these crazy people here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will give me credit for some things,&rdquo; I said wearily. &ldquo;I did
      NOT give Takahiro smallpox, for instance, and&mdash;if you will permit me
      to mention the fact&mdash;Aunt Selina is not MY Aunt Selina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to speak to you about,&rdquo; Jimmy went on wretchedly,
      trying not to look at me. &ldquo;You see, when they were rowing so about who
      would get the breakfast&mdash;I never saw such a lot of people; half of
      them never touch breakfast, but of course now they want all kinds of
      things&mdash;when they were talking, Aunt Selina said she knew YOU would
      get it, being the hostess, and responsible, besides knowing where things
      are kept.&rdquo; He had fixed his eyes on the orchids, and he looked shrunken,
      actually shrunken. &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;you might give me a few
      pointers now, and I could come down in the morning, and&mdash;and fuss up
      something, coffee and so on. I would say you did it! Oh, hang it all, Kit,
      why don&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to say?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;That I love to cook, and of
      course I&rsquo;ll fix trays and carry them up in the morning to Anne Brown and
      Leila Mercer and the rest; and that I will have the shaving water ready&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; Jimmy said, with a sudden resolution. &ldquo;Aunt
      Selina and her money can go to blazes. I am going right upstairs and tell
      her the truth, tell her who you are, what I am, and all the rest of it.&rdquo;
       He opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; I gasped, catching him in time. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you dare, Jimmy Wilson! Why, what would they think of me? After letting
      her call me Bella, and him&mdash;Jim, if Mr. Harbison ever learns the
      truth&mdash;I&mdash;I will take poison. If we are going to be shut up here
      together, we will have to carry it on. I couldn&rsquo;t stand the disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of an heroic effort, Jim looked relieved. &ldquo;They have been hunting
      for the linen closet,&rdquo; he said, more cheerfully, &ldquo;and there will be room
      enough, I think. Harbison and I will hang out in the studio; there are two
      couches there. I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to take Aunt Selina, Kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said coldly. That was the way it was all along. Whenever
      there was something to do that no one else would undertake&mdash;any
      unpleasant responsibility&mdash;that entire mongrel household turned with
      one gesture and pointed its finger at me! Well, it is over now, and I
      ought not to be bitter, considering everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite characteristic of that memorable evening (that is quite
      novelesque, I think) that my interview with Jimmy should have a
      sensational ending. He was terribly down, of course, and as I was trying
      to pass him to get to the door, he caught my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a girl in a thousand, Kit,&rdquo; he said forlornly. &ldquo;If I were not so
      damnably, hopelessly, idiotically in love with&mdash;somebody else, I
      should be crazy about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be maudlin,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;Would you mind letting my hand go?&rdquo; I
      felt sure Bella could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now, Kit,&rdquo; he implored, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve always got along so well. It&rsquo;s a
      shame to let a thing like this make us bad friends. Aren&rsquo;t you ever going
      to forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I said promptly. &ldquo;When I once get away, I don&rsquo;t want ever to see
      you again. I was never so humiliated in my life. I loathe you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I turned around, and, of course, there was Aunt Selina with her eyes
      protruding until you could have knocked them off with a stick, and beside
      her, very red and uncomfortable, Mr. Harbison!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella!&rdquo; she said in a shocked voice, &ldquo;is that the way you speak to your
      husband! It is high time I came here, I think, and took a hand in this
      affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind, Aunt Selina,&rdquo; Jim said, with a sheepish grin. &ldquo;Kit&mdash;Bella
      is tired and nervous. This is a h&mdash;deuce of a situation. No&mdash;er&mdash;servants,
      and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Aunt Selina did mind, and showed it. She pulled the unlucky Harbison
      man through the door and closed it, and then stood glaring at both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every little quarrel is an apple knocked from the tree of love,&rdquo; she
      announced oratorically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was a very little quarrel,&rdquo; Jim said, edging toward the door; &ldquo;a&mdash;a
      green apple, Aunt Selina, a colicky little green apple.&rdquo; But she was not
      to be diverted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella,&rdquo; she said severely, &ldquo;you said you loathed him. You didn&rsquo;t mean
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do!&rdquo; I cried hysterically. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any word to tell how I&mdash;how
      I detest him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I swept past them all and flew to Bella&rsquo;s dressing room and locked
      myself in. Aunt Selina knocked until she was tired, then gave up and went
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the night Anne Brown&rsquo;s pearl collar was stolen!

    <h2>
      Chapter VI. A MIGHTY POOR JOKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course, one knows that there are people who in a different grade of
      society would be shoplifters and pickpockets. When they are restrained by
      obligation or environment they become a little overkeen at bridge, or take
      the wrong sables, or stuff a gold-backed brush into a muff at a reception.
      You remember the ivory dressing set that Theodora Bucknell had, fastened
      with fine gold chains? And the sensation it caused at the Bucknell
      cotillion when Mrs. Van Zire went sweeping to her carriage with two feet
      of gold chain hanging from the front of her wrap?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anne&rsquo;s pearl collar was different. In the first place, instead of
      three or four hundred people, the suspicion had to be divided among ten.
      And of those ten, at least eight of us were friends, and the other two had
      been vouched for by the Browns and Jimmy. It was a horrible mix-up. For
      the necklace was gone&mdash;there couldn&rsquo;t be any doubt of that&mdash;and
      although, as Dallas said, it couldn&rsquo;t get out of the house, still, there
      were plenty of places to hide the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of our trouble really originated with Max Reed, after all. For
      it was Max who made the silly wager over the telephone, with Dick Bagley.
      He bet five hundred even that one of us, at least, would break quarantine
      within the next twenty-four hours, and, of course, that settled it. Dick
      told it around the club as a joke, and a man who owns a newspaper heard
      him and called up the paper. Then the paper called up the health office,
      after setting up a flaming scare-head, &ldquo;Will Money Free Them? Board of
      Health versus Millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was almost three when the house settled down&mdash;nobody had any night
      clothes, although finally, through Dallas, who gave them to Anne, who gave
      them to the rest, we got some things of Jimmy&rsquo;s&mdash;and I was still
      dressed. The house was perfectly quiet, and, after listening carefully, I
      went slowly down the stairs. There was a light in the hall, and another
      back in the dining room, and I got along without any trouble. But the
      pantry, where the stairs led down, was dark, and the wretched swinging
      door would not stay open.
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught my skirt in the door as I went through, and I had to stop to
      loosen it. And in that awful minute I heard some one breathing just beside
      me. I had stooped to my gown, and I turned my head without straightening&mdash;I
      couldn&rsquo;t have raised myself to an erect posture, for my knees were giving
      way under me&mdash;and just at my feet lay the still glowing end of a
      match!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to swallow twice before I could speak. Then I said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was so close it is a wonder I had not walked into him; his voice
      was right at my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I startled you,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I was afraid to speak
      suddenly, or move, for fear I would do&mdash;what I have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Harbison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought you were&mdash;it is very late,&rdquo; I managed to say, with
      dry lips. &ldquo;Do you know where the electric switch is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilson!&rdquo; It was clear he had not known me before. &ldquo;Why, no; don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all confused,&rdquo; I muttered, and beat a retreat into the dining room.
      There, in the friendly light, we could at least see each other, and I
      think he was as much impressed by the fact that I had not undressed as I
      was by the fact that he HAD, partly. He wore a hideous dressing gown of
      Jimmy&rsquo;s, much too small, and his hair, parted and plastered down in the
      early evening, stood up in a sort of brown brush all over his head. He was
      trying to flatten it with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said, with polite surprise, &ldquo;and the house
      is like a barn. You ought not to be running around with your arms
      uncovered, Mrs. Wilson. Surely you could have called some of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wish to disturb any one,&rdquo; I said, with distinct truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are like me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The novelty of the situation&mdash;and
      everything. I got to thinking things over, and then I realized the studio
      was getting cold, so I thought I would come down and take a look at the
      furnace. I didn&rsquo;t suppose any one else would think of it. But I lost
      myself in that pantry, stumbled against a half-open drawer, and nearly
      went down the dumb-waiter.&rdquo; And, as if in judgment on me, at that instant
      came two rather terrific thumps from somewhere below, and inarticulate
      words, shouted rather than spoken. It was uncanny, of course, coming as it
      did through the register at our feet. Mr. Harbison looked startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way,&rdquo; I said, as carelessly as I could. &ldquo;In the excitement, I
      forgot to mention it. There is a policeman asleep in the furnace room. I&mdash;I
      suppose we will have to keep him now,&rdquo; I finished as airily as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a policeman&mdash;in the cellar,&rdquo; he repeated, staring at me, and he
      moved toward the pantry door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go down,&rdquo; I said feverishly, with visions of Bella Knowles
      sitting on the kitchen table, surrounded by soiled dishes and all the
      cheerless aftermath of a dinner party. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go down. I&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      one of my rules&mdash;never to let a stranger go down to the kitchen. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      peculiar&mdash;that way&mdash;and besides, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s mussy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bang! Crash! through the register pipe, and some language quite
      articulate. Then silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mrs. Wilson,&rdquo; he said resolutely. &ldquo;What do I care about the
      kitchen? I&rsquo;m going down and arrest that policeman for disturbing the
      peace. He will have the pipes down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not go,&rdquo; I said with desperate firmness. &ldquo;He&mdash;he is
      probably in a very dangerous state just now. We&mdash;I&mdash;locked him
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Harbison man grinned and then became serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me the whole thing?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in
      trouble all evening, and&mdash;you can trust me, you know, because I am a
      stranger; because the minute this crazy quarantine is raised I am off to
      the Argentine Republic,&rdquo; (perhaps he said Chili) &ldquo;and because I don&rsquo;t know
      anything at all about you. You see, I have to believe what you tell me,
      having no personal knowledge of any of you to go on. Now tell me&mdash;whom
      have you hidden in the cellar, besides the policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no use trying to deceive him; he was looking straight into my
      eyes. So I decided to make the best of a bad thing. Anyhow, it was going
      to require strength to get Bella through the coal hole with one arm and
      restrain the policeman with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, making a sudden resolution, and led the way down the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing when he saw Bella, for which I was grateful. She was
      sitting at the table, with her arms in front of her, and her head buried
      in them. And then I saw she was asleep. Her hat and veil were laid beside
      her, and she had taken off her coat and draped it around her. She had
      rummaged out a cold pheasant and some salad, and had evidently had a
      little supper. Supper and a nap, while I worried myself gray-headed about
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she came in unexpectedly&mdash;something about the butler,&rdquo; I
      explained under my breath. &ldquo;And&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t want to stay. She is on
      bad terms with&mdash;with some of the people upstairs. You can see how
      impossible the situation is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if we can get her out,&rdquo; he said, as if the situation were quite
      ordinary. &ldquo;However, we can try. She seems very comfortable. It&rsquo;s a pity to
      rouse her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the prisoner in the furnace room broke out afresh. It sounded as
      though he had taken a lump of coal and was attacking the lock. Mr.
      Harbison followed the noise, and I could hear him arguing, not gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another sound,&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t get out of here at all,
      unless you crawl up the furnace pipe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came back, Bella was rousing. She lifted her head with her eyes
      shut and then opened them one at a time, blinked, and sat up. She didn&rsquo;t
      see him at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wretch!&rdquo; she said ungratefully, after she had yawned. &ldquo;Do you know
      what time it is? And that&mdash;&rdquo; Then she saw Mr. Harbison and sat
      staring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Harbison,&rdquo; I said to her hastily. &ldquo;He&mdash;he came with Anne
      and Dal and&mdash;he is shut in, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By that time Bella had seen how handsome he was, and she took a hair pin
      out of her mouth, and arched her eyebrows, which was always Bella&rsquo;s best
      pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Miss Knowles,&rdquo; she said sweetly (of course, the court had given her
      back her name), &ldquo;and I stopped in tonight, thinking the house was empty,
      to see about a&mdash;a butler. Unfortunately, the house was quarantined
      just at that time, and&mdash;here I am. Surely there can not be any harm
      in helping me to get out?&rdquo; (Pleading tone.) &ldquo;I have not been exposed to
      any contagion, and in the exhausted state of my health the confinement
      would be positively dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rolled her eyes at him, and I could see she was making an impression.
      Of course she was free. She had a perfect right to marry again, but I will
      say this: Bella is a lot better looking by electric light than she is the
      next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of it was that the gentleman who built bridges and looked down
      on society from a lofty, lonely pinnacle agreed to help one of the most
      gleaming members of the aforesaid society to outwit the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took about fifteen minutes to quiet the policeman. Nobody ever knew
      what Mr. Harbison did to him, but for twenty-four hours he was quite
      tractable. He changed after that, but that comes later in the story.
      Anyhow, the Harbison man went upstairs and came down with a Bagdad curtain
      and a cushion to match, and took them into the furnace room, and came out
      and locked the door behind him, and then we were ready for Bella&rsquo;s escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were four special officers and three reporters watching the
      house, as a result of Max Reed&rsquo;s idiocy. Once, after trying all the other
      windows and finding them guarded, we discovered a little bit of a hole in
      an out-of-the-way corner that looked like a ventilator and was covered
      with a heavy wire screen. No prisoners ever dug their way out of a dungeon
      with more energy than that with which we attached that screen, hacking at
      it with kitchen knives, whispering like conspirators, being scratched with
      the ragged edges of the wire, frozen with the cold air one minute and
      boiling with excitement the next. And when the wire was cut, and Bella had
      rolled her coat up and thrust it through and was standing on a chair ready
      to follow, something outside that had looked like a barrel moved, and
      said, &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I were you. It would be certain to be
      undignified, and probably it would be unpleasant&mdash;later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We coaxed and pleaded and tried to bribe, and that happened, as it turned
      out, to be one of the worst things we had to endure. For the whole
      conversation came out the next afternoon in the paper, with the most awful
      drawings, and the reporter said it was the flashing of the jewels we wore
      that first attracted his attention. And that brings me back to the
      robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      For when we had crept back to the kitchen, and Bella was fumbling for her
      handkerchief to cry into and the Harbison man was trying to apologize for
      the language he had used to the reporter, and I was on the verge of a
      nervous chill&mdash;well, it was then that Bella forgot all about crying
      and jumped and held out her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My diamond bracelet!&rdquo; she screeched. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ve lost it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, we went over every inch of that basement, until I knew every crack
      in the flooring, every spot on the cement. And Bella was nasty, and said
      that she had never seen that part of the house in such condition, and that
      if I had acted like a sane person and put her out, when she had no
      business there at all, she would have had her freedom and her bracelet,
      and that if we were playing a joke on her (as if we felt like joking!) we
      would please give her the bracelet and let her go and die in a corner; she
      felt very queer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past four o&rsquo;clock we gave up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you wore it here. No one could have
      taken it. There wasn&rsquo;t a soul in this part of the house, except the
      policeman and he&rsquo;s locked in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock we put her to sleep in the den. She was in a fearful
      temper, and I was glad enough to be able to shut the door on her. Tom
      Harbison&mdash;that was his name&mdash;helped me to creep upstairs, and
      wanted to get me a glass of ale to make me sleep. But I said it would be
      of no use, as I had to get up and get the breakfast. The last thing he
      said was that the policeman seemed above the average in intelligence, and
      perhaps we could train him to do plain cooking and dishwashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not go to sleep at once. I lay on the chintz-covered divan in
      Bella&rsquo;s dressing room and stared at the picture of her with the violets
      underneath. I couldn&rsquo;t see what there was about Bella to inspire such
      undying devotion, but I had to admit that she had looked handsome that
      night, and that the Harbison man had certainly been impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock Jimmy Wilson pounded at my door, and I could have choked
      him joyfully. I dragged myself to the door and opened it, and then I heard
      excited voices. Everybody seemed to be up but Aunt Selina, and they were
      all talking at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne Brown was in the corner of the group, waving her hands, while Dallas
      was trying to hook the back of her gown with one hand and hold a blanket
      around himself with the other. No one was dressed except Anne, and she had
      been up for an hour, looking in shoes and under the corners of rugs and
      around the bed clothing for her jeweled collar. When she saw me she began
      all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had it on when I went into my room,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and I put it on the
      dressing table when I undressed. I meant to put it under my pillow, but I
      forgot. And I didn&rsquo;t sleep well; I was awake half the night. Wasn&rsquo;t I,
      Dal? Then, when the clock downstairs in the hall was chiming five,
      something roused me, and I sat up in bed. It was still dark, but I pinched
      Dal and said there was somebody in the room. You remember that, don&rsquo;t you,
      Dal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had nightmare,&rdquo; he said sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lay still for ages, it seemed to me, and then&mdash;the door into the
      hall closed. I heard the catch click. I turned on the light over the bed
      then, and the room was empty. I thought of my collar, and although it
      seemed ridiculous, with the house sealed as it is, and all of us friends
      for years&mdash;well, I got up and looked, and it was gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke for an instant. It WAS a queer situation, for the collar was
      gone; Anne&rsquo;s red eyes showed it was true. And there we stood, every one of
      us a miserable picture of guilt, and tried to look innocent and debonair
      and unsuspicious. Finally Jim held up his hand and signified that he
      wanted to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until this thing is cleared up, for Heaven&rsquo;s
      sake, let&rsquo;s try to be sane! If every fellow thinks the other fellow did
      it, this house will be a nice little hell to live in. And if anybody&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he glared around&mdash;&ldquo;if anybody has got funny and is hiding those
      jewels, I want to say that he&rsquo;d better speak up now. Later, it won&rsquo;t be so
      easy for him. It&rsquo;s a mighty poor joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But nobody spoke.

      Chapter VII. WE MAKE AN OMELET
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Betty Mercer who said she was hungry, and got us switched from the
      delicate subject of which was the thief to the quite as pressing subject
      of which was to be cook. Aunt Selina had slept quietly through the whole
      thing&mdash;we learned afterward that she customarily slept on her left
      side, which was on her good ear. We gathered in the Dallas Browns&rsquo; room,
      and Jimmy proposed a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can have anything sent in that we want,&rdquo; he suggested speciously, &ldquo;and
      if Dal doesn&rsquo;t make good with the city fathers, you girls can get some
      clothes anyhow. Then, we can have dinner sent from one of the hotels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not all the meals?&rdquo; Max suggested. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not going to be
      small about things, Jimmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be easy,&rdquo; Jim persisted, ignoring the remark, &ldquo;for nine
      reasonably intelligent people to boil eggs and make coffee, which is all
      we need for breakfast, with some fruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine of us!&rdquo; Dallas said wickedly, looking at Tom Harbison, who was out
      of earshot, &ldquo;Why nine of us? I thought Kit here, otherwise known as Bella,
      was going to show off her housewifely skill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It ended, however, with Mr. Harbison writing out a lot of slips, cook,
      scullery-maid, chamber-maid, parlor-maid, furnace-man, and butler, and as
      that left two people over&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t count Aunt Selina&mdash;he added
      another furnace-man and a trained nurse. Betty Mercer drew the trained
      nurse slip, and, of course, she was delighted. It seems funny now to look
      back and think what a dreadful time she really had, for Aunt Selina took
      the grippe, you know, that very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fate that I should go back to that awful kitchen, for of course my
      slip said &ldquo;cook.&rdquo; Mr. Harbison was butler, and Max and Dal got the
      furnace, although neither of them had ever been nearer to a bucket of coal
      than the coupons on mining stock. Anne got the bedrooms, and Leila was
      parlor-maid. It was Jimmy who got the scullery work, but he was quite
      crushed by this time, and did not protest at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max was in a very bad temper; I suppose he had not had enough sleep&mdash;no
      one had. But he came over while the lottery was going on and stood over me
      and demanded unpleasantly, in a whisper, that I stop masquerading as
      another man&rsquo;s wife and generally making a fool of myself&mdash;which is
      the way he put it. And I knew in my heart that he was right, and I hated
      him for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and tell him&mdash;them?&rdquo; I asked nastily. No one was
      paying any attention to us. &ldquo;Tell them that, to be obliging, I have nearly
      drowned in a sea of lies; tell them that I am not only not married, but
      that I never intend to marry; tell them that we are a lot of idiots with
      nothing better to do than to trifle with strangers within our gates,
      people who build&mdash;I mean, people that are worth two to our one! Run
      and tell them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me for a minute, then he turned on his heel and left me. It
      looked as though Max might be going to be difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was improvising an apron out of a towel, and Anne was pinning a
      sheet into a kimono, so she could take off her dinner gown and still be
      proper, Dallas harked back to the robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann put the collar on the table there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake
      about that. I watched her do it, for I remember thinking it was the sole
      reminder I had that Consolidated Traction ever went above thirty-nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max was looking around the room, examining the window locks and whistling
      between his teeth. He was in disgrace with every one, for by that time it
      was light enough to see three reporters with cameras across the street
      waiting for enough sun to snap the house, and everybody knew that it was
      Max and his idiotic wager that had done it. He had made two or three
      conciliatory remarks, but no one would speak to him. His antics were so
      queer, however, that we were all watching him, and when he had felt over
      the rug with his hands, and raised the edges, and tried to lift out the
      chair seats, and had shaken out Dal&rsquo;s shoes (he said people often hid
      things and then forgot about it), he made a proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will take that infernal furnace from around my neck, I&rsquo;ll
      undertake either to find the jewels or to show up the thief,&rdquo; he said
      quietly. And of course, with all the people in the house under suspicion,
      every one had to hail the suggestion with joy, and to offer his
      assistance, and Jimmy had to take Max&rsquo;s share of the furnace. So they took
      the scullery slip downstairs to the policeman, and gave Jim Max&rsquo;s share of
      the furnace. (Yes, I had broken the policeman to them gently. Of course,
      Anne said at once that he was the thief, but they found him tucked in and
      sound asleep with his back against the furnace.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; Max said, standing importantly in the middle of the
      room, &ldquo;we retired between two and three&mdash;nearer three. So the theft
      occurred between three and five, when Anne woke up. Was your door locked,
      Dal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The door into the hall was, but the door into the dressing room was
      open, and we found the door from there into the hall open this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From three until five,&rdquo; Max repeated. &ldquo;Was any one out of his room during
      that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Tom Harbison promptly, from the foot of the bed. &ldquo;I was
      prowling all around somewhere about four, searching&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced at
      me&mdash;&ldquo;for a drink of water. But as I don&rsquo;t know a pearl from a glass
      bead, I hope you exonerate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed and said, &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sure, old man,&rdquo; and changed
      the subject quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      While that excitement was on, I got Jim to one side and told him about
      Bella. His good-natured face was radiant at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she DID come to see Takahiro, eh, Kit?&rdquo; he asked delicately.
      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say anything about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing good. She said the house was in a disgraceful condition,&rdquo; I said
      heartlessly. &ldquo;And her diamond bracelet was stolen while she took a nap on
      the kitchen table&rdquo;&mdash;he groaned&mdash;&ldquo;and&mdash;oh, Jim, you are such
      a goose! If I could only manage my own affairs the way I could my
      friends&rsquo;! She&rsquo;s too sure of you, Jimmy. She knows you adore her, and&mdash;how
      brutal could you be, Jim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I may have undiscovered depths of brutality that I have
      never had occasion to use. However, I might try. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Jim,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;It was always Bella who did things here; she
      managed the house, she tyrannized over her friends, and she bullied you.
      Yes, she did. Now she&rsquo;s here, without your invitation, and she has to
      stay. It&rsquo;s your turn to bully, to dictate terms, to be coldly civil or
      politely rude. Make her furious at you. If she is jealous, so much the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far would you sacrifice yourself on the altar of friendship?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may pay me all the attention you like, in public,&rdquo; I replied, and
      after we shook hands we went together to Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an ominous pause when we went into the den. Bella was sitting by
      the register, with her furs on, and after one glance over her shoulder at
      us, she looked away again without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella,&rdquo; Jim said appealingly. And then I pinched his arm, and he drew
      himself up and looked properly outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bella,&rdquo; he said, coldly this time, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why you have put
      yourself in this ridiculous position, but since you have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned on him in a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put MYSELF in this position!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was frantic. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a plot, a wretched trick of yours, this quarantine,
      to keep me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim gasped, but I gave him a warning glance, and he swallowed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; he said, with maddening quiet, &ldquo;I would be the last
      person in the world to wish to perpetuate an indiscretion of yours. For it
      was hardly discreet, was it, to visit a bachelor establishment alone at
      ten o&rsquo;clock at night? As far as my plotting to keep you here is concerned,
      I assure you that nothing could be further from my mind. Our paths were to
      be two parallel lines that never touch.&rdquo; He looked at me for approval, and
      Bella was choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are worse that I ever thought you,&rdquo; she stormed. &ldquo;I thought you were
      only a&mdash;a fool. Now I know you&mdash;for a brute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, it ended by Jim&rsquo;s graciously permitting Bella to remain&mdash;there
      being nothing else to do&mdash;and by his magnanimously agreeing to keep
      her real identity from Aunt Selina and Mr. Harbison, and to break the news
      of her presence to Anne and the rest. It created a sensation beside which
      Anne&rsquo;s pearls faded away, although they came to the front again soon
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim broke the news at once, gathering everybody but Harbison and Aunt
      Selina in the upper hall. He was palpitatingly nervous, but he tried to
      carry it off with a high hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate,&rdquo; he said, looking around the circle of faces, each one
      frozen with amazement, and just a suspicion, perhaps of incredulity. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      particularly unfortunate for her. You all know how high-strung she is, and
      if the papers should get hold of it&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll all have to make it
      as easy as we can for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With Jim&rsquo;s eyes on them, they all swallowed the butler story without a
      gulp. But Anne was indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Bella,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Well, she has made her bed and she can
      lie on it. I&rsquo;m sure I shan&rsquo;t make it for her. But if you want to know my
      opinion, Mr. Harbison may be a fool, but you can&rsquo;t ram two Bellas, both
      NEE Knowles, down Miss Caruthers&rsquo; throat with a stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had not thought of that before and every one looked blank. Finally,
      however, Jim said Bella&rsquo;s middle name was Constantia, and we decided to
      call her that. But it turned out afterward that nobody could remember it
      in a hurry, and generally when we wanted to attract her attention, we
      walked across the room and touched her on the shoulder. It was quicker and
      safer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name decided, we went downstairs in a line to welcome Bella, to try to
      make her feel at home, and to forget her deplorable situation. Leila had
      worked herself into a really sympathetic frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear,&rdquo; she said, on the way down. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t grin, anybody, just be
      cordial and glad to see her. I hope she doesn&rsquo;t cry; you know the spells
      she takes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stopped outside the door, and everybody tried to look cheerful and
      sympathetic, and not grinny&mdash;which was as hard as looking as if we
      had had a cup of tea&mdash;and then Jim threw the door open and we filed
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella was comfortably reading by the fire. She had her feet up on a stool
      and a pillow behind her head. She did not even look at us for a minute;
      then she merely glanced up as she turned a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she said mockingly, &ldquo;what a lot of frumps you all are! I had
      hoped it was some one with my breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she went on reading. As Leila said afterward, that kind of person
      OUGHT to be divorced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina came down just then and I left everybody trying to explain
      Bella&rsquo;s presence to her, and fled to the kitchen. The Harbison man
      appeared while I was sitting hopelessly in front of the gas range, and
      showed me about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I ever saw one,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, &ldquo;but I know the
      theory. Likewise, by the same token, this tea kettle, set on the flame,
      will boil. That is not theory, however, that is early knowledge. &lsquo;Polly,
      put the kettle on; we&rsquo;ll all take tea.&rsquo; Look at that, Mrs. Wilson. I
      didn&rsquo;t fight bacilli with boiled water at Chickamauga for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he let out the policeman and brought him into the kitchen. He was
      a large man, and his face was a curious mixture of amazement, alarm and
      dignity. No doubt we did look queer, still in parts of our evening clothes
      and I in the white silk and lace petticoat that belonged under my gown,
      with a yellow and black pajama coat of Jimmy&rsquo;s as a sort of breakfast
      jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Officer Flannigan,&rdquo; Mr. Harbison said. &ldquo;I explained our
      unfortunate position earlier in the morning, and he is prepared to accept
      our hospitality. Flannigan, every person in this house has got to work, as
      I also explained to you. You are appointed dishwasher and scullery maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman looked dazed. Then, slowly, like dawn over a sleeping lake,
      a light of comprehension grew in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said, laying his helmet on the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to be doing
      anything I can to help. Me and Mrs. Wilson&mdash;we used to be friends.
      It&rsquo;s many the time I&rsquo;ve opened the carriage door for her, and she with her
      head in the air, and for all that, the pleasant smile. When any one around
      her was having a party and wanted a special officer, it was Mrs. Wilson
      that always said, Get Flannigan, Officer Timothy Flannigan. He&rsquo;s your
      man.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart had been going lower and lower. So he knew Bella, and he knew I
      was not Bella, although he had not grasped the fact that I was usurping
      her place. The odious Harbison man sat on the table and swung his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you know,&rdquo; he said, looking around him, &ldquo;how good it is to
      see a white woman so perfectly at home in a civilized kitchen again, after
      two years of food cooked by a filthy Indian squaw over a portable
      sheet-iron stove!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      SO PERFECTLY AT HOME? I stood in the middle of the room and stared around
      at the copper things hanging up and the rows of blue and white crockery,
      and the dozens and hundreds of complicated-looking utensils, whose names I
      had never even heard, and I was dazed. I tried with some show of authority
      to instruct Flannigan about gathering up the soiled things, and, after
      listening in puzzled silence for a minute, he stripped off his blue coat
      with a tolerant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lave em to me, miss,&rdquo; he said. The &ldquo;miss&rdquo; passed unnoticed. &ldquo;I mayn&rsquo;t
      give em a Turkish bath, which is what you are describin&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;ll get the
      grease off all right. I always clean up while the missus is in bed with a
      young un.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rolled up his sleeves, found a brown checked gingham apron behind the
      door, and tied it around his neck with the ease of practice. Then he
      cleared off the plates, eating what appealed to him as he did so, and
      stopping now and again for a deep-throated chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said once, stopping with a dish in the air, &ldquo;what a
      deuce of a noise there will be when the vaccination doctor comes around
      this mornin&rsquo;. In a week every one of us will be nursin&rsquo; a sore arm or
      walkin&rsquo; on one leg, beggin&rsquo; your pardon, miss. The last time the force was
      vaccinated, I asked to be done behind me ear; I needed me legs and I
      needed me arms, but didn&rsquo;t need me head much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw his head back and laughed. Mr. Harbison laughed. Oh, we were very
      cheerful! And that awful stove stared at me, and the kettle began to hum,
      and Aunt Selina sent down word that she was not well, and would like some
      omelet on her tray. Omelet!
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that it was made of eggs, but that was the extent of my knowledge.
      I muttered an excuse and ran upstairs to Anne, but she was still sniffling
      over her necklace, and said she didn&rsquo;t know anything about omelets and
      didn&rsquo;t care. Food would choke her. Neither of the Mercer girls knew
      either, and Bella, who was still reading in the den, absolutely declined
      to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you if I did. You can get yourself out,
      as you got yourself in,&rdquo; she said nastily. &ldquo;The simplest thing, if you
      don&rsquo;t mind my suggesting it, is to poison the coffee and kill the lot of
      us. Only, if you decide to do it, let me know; I want to live just long
      enough to see Jimmy Wilson WRITHE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella is the kind of person who gets on one&rsquo;s nerves. She finds a
      grievance and hugs it; she does ridiculous things and blames other people.
      And she flirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went downstairs despondently, and found that Mr. Harbison had discovered
      some eggs and was standing helplessly staring at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Omelet&mdash;eggs. Eggs&mdash;omelet. That&rsquo;s the extent of my knowledge,&rdquo;
       he said, when I entered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come to my assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then that I saw the cook book. It was lying on a shelf beside the
      clock, and while Mr. Harbison had his back turned I got it down. It was
      quite clear that the domestic type of woman was his ideal, and I did not
      care to outrage his belief in me. So I took the cook book into the pantry
      and read the recipe over three times. When I came back I knew it by heart,
      although I did not understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you how,&rdquo; I said with a great deal of dignity, &ldquo;and since you
      want to help, you may make it yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Suppose you give me the idea first. Then we&rsquo;ll go over
      it slowly, bit by bit. We&rsquo;ll make a big fluffy omelet, and if the others
      aren&rsquo;t around, we&rsquo;ll eat it ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, trying to remember exactly, &ldquo;you take two eggs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Two eggs for ten people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me,&rdquo; I said irritably. &ldquo;If&mdash;if two isn&rsquo;t enough we
      can make several omelets, one after the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else but you would have thought of that!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Well, here
      are two eggs. What next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Separate them,&rdquo; I said easily. No, I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant. I hoped
      he would; I said it as casually as I could, and I did not look at him. I
      knew he was staring at me, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Separate them!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, they aren&rsquo;t fastened together!&rdquo; Then he
      laughed. &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course!&rdquo; When I looked he had put one at each end of
      the table. &ldquo;Afraid they&rsquo;ll quarrel, I suppose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, now
      they&rsquo;re separated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First separate, then beat!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;The author of that cook book
      must have had a mean disposition. What&rsquo;s next? Hang them?&rdquo; He looked up at
      me with his boyish smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Separate and beat,&rdquo; I repeated. If I lost a word of that recipe I was
      gone. It was like saying the alphabet; I had to go to the beginning every
      time mentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t beat an egg, no matter how cruel you may
      be, unless you break it first.&rdquo; He picked up an egg and looked at it.
      &ldquo;Separate!&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;the white from the&mdash;whatever you
      cooking experts call it&mdash;the yellow part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; I exclaimed, light breaking on me. &ldquo;Of course. I KNEW you would
      find it out.&rdquo; Then back to the recipe&mdash;&ldquo;beat until well mixed; then
      fold in the whites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fold?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;It looks pretty thin to fold, doesn&rsquo;t it? I&mdash;upon
      my word, I never heard of folding an egg. Are you&mdash;but of course you
      know. Please come and show me how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just fold them in,&rdquo; I said desperately. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t difficult.&rdquo; And because
      I was so transparent a fraud and knew he must find me out then, I said
      something about butter, and went into the pantry. That&rsquo;s the trouble with
      a lie; somebody asks you to tell one as a favor to somebody else, and the
      first thing you know, you are having to tell a thousand, and trying to
      remember the ones you have told so you won&rsquo;t contradict yourself, and the
      very person you have tried to help turns on you and reproaches you for
      being untruthful! I leaned my elbows despondently on the shelf of the
      kitchen pantry, with the feet of a guard visible through the high window
      over my head, and waited for Mr. Harbison to come in and demand that I
      fold a raw egg, and discover that I didn&rsquo;t know anything about cooking,
      and was just as useless as all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came. He held the bowl out to me and waved a fork in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have solved it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Or, rather, Flannigan and I have solved it.
      The mixture awaits the magic touch of the cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I honestly thought I could do the rest. It was only to be put in a pan and
      browned, and then in the oven three minutes. And I did it properly, but
      for two things: I should have greased the pan (but this was the book&rsquo;s
      fault; it didn&rsquo;t say) and I should have lighted the oven. The latter,
      however, was Mr. Harbison&rsquo;s fault as much as mine, and I had wit enough to
      lay it to absent-mindedness on the part of both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Aunt Selina or no Aunt Selina, we decided to have boiled eggs,
      and Mr. Harbison knew how to cook them. He put them in the tea kettle and
      then went to look at the furnace. And Officer Timothy Flannigan ground the
      coffee and gave his opinion of the board of health in no stinted terms. As
      for me, I burned my fingers and the toast, and felt myself growing hot and
      cold, for I was going to be found out as soon as Flannigan grasped the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, I did the thing that caused me so much trouble later. I
      put down the toaster&mdash;at least the Harbison man said it was a toaster&mdash;and
      went over and stood in front of the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you will understand&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but&mdash;but
      if anything occurs to&mdash;to make you think I am not&mdash;that things
      are not what they seem to be&mdash;I mean, what I say they are&mdash;you
      will understand that it is a joke, won&rsquo;t you? A joke, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was what I said. I know it sounds like a raving delirium, but
      when Max came down and squizzled some bacon, as he said, and told
      Flannigan about the robbery, and how, whether it was a joke or deadly
      earnest, somebody in the house had taken Anne&rsquo;s pearls, that wretched
      policeman winked at me solemnly over Max&rsquo;s shoulder. Oh, it was awful!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, to add to my discomfort, the most unpleasant ideas WOULD obtrude
      themselves. WHAT was Mr. Harbison doing on the first floor of the house
      that night? Ice water, he had said. But there had been plenty of water in
      the studio! And he had told me it was the furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison came back in a half hour, and I remembered the eggs. We
      fished them out of the tea kettle, and they were perfectly hard, but we
      ate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor from the board of health came that morning and vaccinated us.
      There was a great deal of excitement, and Aunt Selina was done on the arm.
      As she did not affect evening clothes this was entirely natural, but later
      on in the week, when the wretched things began to take, nobody dared to
      limp, and Leila made a terrible break by wearing a bandage on her left
      arm, after telling Aunt Selina that she had been vaccinated on the right.

      Chapter VIII. CORRESPONDENTS&rsquo; DEPARTMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following letters were found in the house post box after the lifting
      of the quarantine, and later were presented to me by their writers, bound
      in white kid (the letters, not the authors, of course).

    <p>
      FROM THOMAS HARBISON, LATE ENGINEER OF BRIDGES, PERUVIAN TRUNK LINES,
      SOUTH AMERICA, TO HENRY LLEWELLYN, CARE OF UNION NITRATE COMPANY, IQUIQUE,
      CHILI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Old Man:
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I was fully a week trying to drive out of my mind my last glimpse
      of you with your sickly grin, pretending to be tickled to pieces that the
      only white man within two hundred miles of your shack was going on a
      holiday. You old bluffer! I used to hang over the rail of the steamer, on
      the way up, and see you standing as I left you beside the car with its
      mule and the Indian driver, and behind you a million miles of
      soul-destroying pampa. Never mind, Jack; I sent yesterday by mail steamer
      the cigarettes, pipes and tobacco, canned goods and poker chips. Put in
      some magazines, too, and the collars. Don&rsquo;t know about the ties&mdash;guess
      it won&rsquo;t matter down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened on the trip. One of the engines broke down three days
      out, and I spent all my time below decks for forty-eight hours. Chief
      engineer raving with D.T.&lsquo;s. Got the engine fixed in record time, and
      haven&rsquo;t got my hands clean yet. It was bully.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this I send the papers, which will tell you how I happen to be here,
      and why I have leisure to write you three days after landing. If the
      situation were not so ridiculous, it would be maddening. Here I am, off
      for a holiday and congratulating myself that I am foot free and heart free&mdash;yes,
      my friend, heart free&mdash;here I am, shut in the house of a man I never
      saw until last night, and wouldn&rsquo;t care if I never saw again, with a lot
      of people who never heard of me, who are almost equally vague about South
      America, who play as hard at bridge as I ever worked at building one
      (forgive this, won&rsquo;t you? The novelty has gone to my head), and who belong
      to the very class of extravagant, luxury-loving, non-producing parasites
      (isn&rsquo;t that what we called them?) that you and I used to revile from our
      lofty Andean pinnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      To come down to earth: here we are, six women and five men, including a
      policeman, not a servant in the house, and no one who knows how to do
      anything. They are really immensely interesting, these people; they all
      know each other very well, and it is &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; here, and &ldquo;Dal&rdquo; there&mdash;Dallas
      Brown, who went to India with me, you remember my speaking of him&mdash;and
      they are good natured, too, except at meal times. The little hostess, Mrs.
      Wilson, took over the cooking, and although luncheon was better than
      breakfast, the food still leaves much to the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you could see this Mrs. Wilson, Hal. You would change a whole lot
      of your ideas. She is a thoroughbred, sure enough, and of course some of
      her beauty is the result of the exquisite care about which you and I&mdash;still
      from our Andean pinnacle&mdash;used to rant. But the fact is, she is more
      than that. She has fire, and pluck, no end. If you could have seen her
      this morning, standing in front of a cold kitchen range, determined to
      conquer it, and had seen the tilt of her chin when I offered to take over
      the cooking&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t grin; I can cook, and you know it&mdash;you
      would understand what I mean. It was so clear that she was paralyzed with
      fright at the idea of getting breakfast, and equally clear that she meant
      to do it. By the way, I have learned that her name was McNair before she
      married this would-be artist, Wilson, and that she is a daughter of the
      McNair who financed the Callao branch!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not met the others so intimately. There are two sisters named
      Mercer, inclined to be noisy&mdash;they are playing roulette in the next
      room now. One is small and dark, almost Hebraic in type, named Leila and
      called Lollie. The other, larger, very blonde and languishing, and with a
      decided preference for masculine society, even, saving the mark, mine!
      Dallas Brown&rsquo;s wife, good looking, smokes cigarettes when I am not around&mdash;they
      all do, except Mrs. Wilson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there is a maiden aunt, who is ill today with grippe and excitement,
      and a Miss Knowles, who came for a moment last night to see Mrs. Wilson,
      was caught in the quarantine (see papers), and, after hiding all night in
      the basement, is sulking all day in her room. Her presence created an
      excitement out of all proportion to the apparent cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the fact that I have reason to know that my artist host and his
      beautiful wife are on bad terms, and from the significant glances with
      which the announcement of Miss Knowles&rsquo; presence was met, the state of
      affairs seems rather clear. Wilson impresses me as a spineless sort,
      anyhow, and when the lady of the basement shut herself away from the rest
      today and I happened on &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; as they call him, pleading with her
      through the door, I very nearly kicked him down the stairs. Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll
      keep out, right enough; it isn&rsquo;t my affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, after the quarantine and with the policeman locked in the
      furnace room, a pearl necklace and a diamond bracelet were stolen! Just
      ten of us to divide the suspicion! Upon my word, Hal, it&rsquo;s the queerest
      situation I ever heard of. Which of us did it? I make a guess that not a
      few of us are fools, but which is the knave? The worst of it is, I am the
      only unaccredited member of the household!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is more scandal than I ever wrote in my life. Lay it to circumscribed
      environment, and the lack of twenty miles over the pampa before breakfast.
      We have all been vaccinated, and the officious gentlemen from the board of
      health have taken their grins and their formaldehyde and gone. Ye gods,
      how we cough!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Carlton order will go through all right, I think. Phoned him this
      morning. If it does, old man, we will take a month in September and
      explore the Mercator property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know, Hal, I have been thinking lately that you and I stick too
      close to the grind. Business is right enough, but what&rsquo;s the use of
      spending one&rsquo;s best years succeeding in everything except the things that
      are worth while? I&rsquo;ll be thirty sooner than I care to say, and&mdash;oh,
      well, you won&rsquo;t understand. You&rsquo;ll sit down there, with the Southern Cross
      and the rest of the infernal astronomical galaxy looking down on you, and
      the Indians chanting in the village, and you will think I have grown
      sentimental. I have not. You and I down there have been looking at the
      world through the reverse end of the glass. It&rsquo;s a bully old world, Hal,
      and this is God&rsquo;s part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burn this letter after you read it; I suspect it is covered with germs.
      Well, happy days, old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, Tom
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S. By the way, can&rsquo;t you spare some of the Indian pottery you picked up
      at Callao? I told Mrs. Wilson about it, and she was immensely interested.
      Send it to this address. Can you get it to the next steamer?&mdash;T.
    </p>

      FROM MAXWELL REED TO RICHARD BURTON BAGLEY, UNIVERSITY CLUB, NEW YORK.

    <p>
      Dear Dick:
    </p>
    <p>
      Enclosed find my check for five hundred, as per wager. Possibly you were
      within your rights in protecting your bet in the manner you chose, but
      while I do not wish to be offensive, your reporters are damnably so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, Maxwell Reed
    </p>
    <p>
      FROM OFFICER FLANNIGAN TO MRS. MAGGIE FLANNIGAN, ERIN STREET.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Maggie:
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as you receive this, go down to Mac and tell him the story as I
      tell you hear. Tell him I was walkin my beat, and I&rsquo;d been afther seein
      Jimmy Alverini about doin the right thing for Mac on Monday, at the poles,
      when I seen a man hangin suspicious around this house, which is Mr.
      Wilson&rsquo;s, on Ninety-fifth. And, of coorse, afther chasin the man a mile or
      more, I lose him, which was not my fault. So I go back to the Wilson
      house, and tell them to be careful about closin up fer the night, and
      while I&rsquo;m standin in the hall, with all the swells around me, sparklin
      with jewels, the board of health sends a man to lock us all in, because
      the Jap thats been waiter has took the smallpox and gone to the hospitle.
      I stood me ground. I sez, sez I, you cant shtop an officer in pursute of
      his duty. I rafuse to be shut in. Be shure to tell Mac that.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here I am, and like to be for a month. Tell Mac theres four votes shut
      up here, and I can get them for him, if he can stop this monkey business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then go over to the Dago Church on Webster Avenue and put a dollar in
      Saint Anthony&rsquo;s box. He&rsquo;ll see me out of this scrape, right enough. Do it
      at once. Now remember, go to Mac first; maybe you can get the dollar from
      him, and mind what you tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your husband, Tim Flannigan

    <p>
      FROM ME TO MOTHER&mdash;MRS. THEODORE McNAIR, HOTEL HAMILTON, BERMUDA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearest Mother:
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you will get this before you read the papers, and when you DO read
      them, you are not to get excited and worried. I am as well as can be, and
      a great deal safer than I ever remember to have been in my life. We are
      quarantined, a lot of us, in Jim Wilson&rsquo;s house, because his
      irreproachable Jap did a very reproachable thing&mdash;took smallpox. Now
      read on before you get excited. HIS ROOM HAS BEEN FUMIGATED, and we have
      been vaccinated. I am well and happy. I can&rsquo;t be killed in a railway wreck
      or smashed when the car skids. Unless I drown myself in my bath, or jump
      through a window, positively nothing can happen to me. So gather up all
      your maternal anxieties and cast them to the Bermuda sharks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne Brown is here&mdash;see the papers for list&mdash;and if she can not
      play propriety, Jimmy&rsquo;s Aunt Selina can. In fact, she doesn&rsquo;t play at it;
      she works. I have telephoned Lizette for some clothes&mdash;enough for a
      couple of weeks, although Dallas promises to get us out sooner. Now, dear,
      do go ahead and have a nice time, and on no account come home. You could
      only have the carriage to stop in front of the house, and wave to me
      through a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother, I want you to do something for me. You know who is down there, and&mdash;this
      is awfully delicate, Mumsy&mdash;but he&rsquo;s a nice boy, and I thought I
      liked him. I guess you know he has been rather attentive. Now, I DO like
      him, Mumsy, but not the way I thought I did, and I want you to&mdash;very
      gently, of course&mdash;to discourage him a little. You know how I mean.
      He&rsquo;s a dear boy, but I am so tired of people who don&rsquo;t know anything but
      horses and motors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, oh, yes,&mdash;do you remember a girl named Lucille Mellon who was at
      school with you in Rome? And that she married a man named Harbison? Well,
      her son is here! He builds railroads and bridges and things, and he even
      built himself an automobile down in South America, because he couldn&rsquo;t
      afford to buy one, and burned wood in it! Wood! Think of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I wired father in Chicago for fear he would come rushing home. The picture
      in the paper of the face at the basement window is supposed to be Mr.
      Harbison, but of course it isn&rsquo;t any more like him than mine is like me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne Brown mislaid her pearl collar when she took it off last night, and
      has fussed herself into a sick headache. She declares it was stolen! Some
      of the people are playing bridge, Betty Mercer is doing a cake walk to the
      RHAPSODIE HONGROISE&mdash;Jim has no every-day music&mdash;and the
      telephone is ringing. We have received enough flowers for a funeral&mdash;somebody
      sent Lollie a Gates Ajar, only with the gates shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no servants&mdash;think of it, Mumsy. I wish you had made me
      learn to cook. Mr. Harbison has shown me a little&mdash;he was a soldier
      in the Spanish War&mdash;but we girls are a terribly ignorant lot, Mumsy,
      about the real things of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, don&rsquo;t worry. It is more sport than camping in the Adirondacks, and
      not nearly so damp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your loving daughter, Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;South America must be wonderful. Why can&rsquo;t we put the Gadfly in
      commission, and take a coasting trip this summer? It is a shame to own a
      yacht and never use it. K.

      Chapter IX. FLANNIGAN&rsquo;S FIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most charitable thing would be to say nothing about the first day. We
      were baldly brutal&mdash;that&rsquo;s the only word for it. And Mr. Harbison,
      with his beautiful courtesy&mdash;the really sincere kind&mdash;tried to
      patch up one quarrel after another and failed. He rose superbly to the
      occasion, and made something that he called a South American goulash for
      luncheon, although it was too salty, and every one was thirsty the rest of
      the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella was horrid, of course. She froze Jim until he said he was going to
      sit in the refrigerator and cool the butter. She locked herself in the
      dressing room&mdash;it had been assigned to me, but that made no
      difference to Bella&mdash;and did her nails, and took three different
      baths, and refused to come to the table. And of course Jimmy was wild, and
      said she would starve. But I said, &ldquo;Very well, let her starve. Not a tray
      shall leave my kitchen.&rdquo; It was a comfort to have her shut up there
      anyhow; it postponed the time when she would come face to face with
      Flannigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina got sick that day, as I have said. I was not so bitter as the
      others; I did not say that I wished she would die. The worst I ever wished
      her was that she might be quite ill for some time, and yet, when she began
      to recover, she was dreadful to me. She said for one thing, that it was
      the hard-boiled eggs and the state of the house that did it, and when I
      said that the grippe was a germ, she retorted that I had probably brought
      it to her on my clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You remember that Betty had drawn the nurse&rsquo;s slip, and how pleased she
      had been about it. She got up early the morning of the first day and made
      herself a lawn cap and telephoned out for a white nurse&rsquo;s uniform&mdash;that
      is, of course, for a white uniform for a nurse. She really looked very
      fetching, and she went around all the morning with a red cross on her
      sleeve and a Saint Cecilia expression, gathering up bottles of medicine&mdash;most
      of it flesh reducer, which was pathetic, and closing windows for fear of
      drafts. She refused to help with the house work, and looked quite exalted,
      but by afternoon it had palled on her somewhat, and she and Max shook
      dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was really pleased when Aunt Selina sent for her. She took in a
      bottle of cologne to bathe her brow, and we all stood outside the door and
      listened. Betty tiptoed in in her pretty cap and apron, and we heard her
      cautiously draw down the shades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo; Aunt Selina demanded. &ldquo;I like the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad for your poor eyes,&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s tone was exactly the proper bedside
      pitch, low and sugary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet and low, sweet and low, wind of the western sea!&rdquo; Dal hummed
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put up those window shades!&rdquo; Aunt Selina&rsquo;s voice was strong enough.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in that bottle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty was still mild. She swished to the window and raised the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m SO sorry you are ill,&rdquo; she said sympathetically. &ldquo;This is for your
      poor aching head. Now close your eyes and lie perfectly still, and I will
      cool your forehead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with my head,&rdquo; Aunt Selina retorted. &ldquo;And I
      have not lost my faculties; I am not a child or a sick cow. If that&rsquo;s
      perfumery, take it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We heard Betty coming to the door, but there was no time to get away. She
      had dropped her mask for a minute and was biting her lip, but when she saw
      us she forced a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ill, poor dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you people will go away, I can bring
      her around all right. In two hours she will eat out of my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat a piece out of your hand,&rdquo; Max scoffed in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      We waited a little longer, but it was too painful. Aunt Selina demanded a
      mustard foot bath and a hot lemonade and her back rubbed with liniment and
      some strong black tea. And in the intervals she wanted to be read to out
      of the prayer book. And when we had all gone away, there came the most
      terrible noise from Aunt Selina&rsquo;s room, and every one ran. We found Betty
      in the hall outside the door, crying, with her fingers in her ears and her
      cap over her eye. She said she had been putting the hot water bottle to
      Aunt Selina&rsquo;s back, and it had been too hot. Just then something hit
      against the door with a soft thud, fell to the floor and burst, for a
      trickle of hot water came over the sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t let me hold her hand,&rdquo; Betty wailed, &ldquo;or bathe her brow, or
      smooth her pillow. She thinks of nothing but her stomach or her back! And
      when I try to make her bed look decent, she spits at me like a cat.
      Everything I do is wrong. She spilled the foot bath into her shoes, and
      blamed me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took the united efforts of all of us&mdash;except Bella, who stood back
      and smiled nastily&mdash;to get Betty back into the sick room again. I was
      supremely thankful by that time that I had not drawn the nurse&rsquo;s slip.
      With dinner ordered in from one of the clubs, and the omelet ten hours
      behind me, my position did not seem so unbearable. But a new development
      was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Betty was fussing with Aunt Selina, Max led a search of the house.
      He said the necklace and the bracelet must be hidden somewhere, and that
      no crevice was too small to neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made a formal search all together, except Betty and Aunt Selina, and we
      found a lot of things in different places that Jim said had been missing
      since the year one. But no jewels&mdash;nothing even suggesting a jewel
      was found. We had explored the entire house, every cupboard, every chest,
      even the insides of the couches and the pockets of Jim&rsquo;s clothes&mdash;which
      he resented bitterly&mdash;and found nothing, and I must say the situation
      was growing rather strained. Some one had taken the jewels; they hadn&rsquo;t
      walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Flannigan who suggested the roof, and as we had tried every place
      else, we climbed there. Of course we didn&rsquo;t find anything, but after all
      day in the house with the shutters closed on account of reporters, the air
      was glorious. It was February, but quite mild and sunny, and we could look
      down over Riverside Drive and the Hudson, and even recognize people we
      knew on horseback and in cars. It was a pathetic joy, and we lined up
      along the parapet and watched the motor boats racing on the river, and
      tried to feel that we were in the world as well as of it, but it was very
      hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty had been making tea for Aunt Selina, and of course when she heard us
      up there, she followed, tray and all, and we drank Aunt Selina&rsquo;s tea and
      had the first really nice time of the day. Bella had come up, too, but she
      was still standoffish and queer, and she stood leaning against a chimney
      and staring out over the river. After a little Mr. Harbison put down his
      cup and went over to her, and they talked quite confidentially for a long
      time. I thought it bad taste in Bella, under the circumstances, after
      snubbing Dallas and Max, and of course treating Jim like the dirt under
      her feet, to turn right around and be lovely to Mr. Harbison. It was hard
      for Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max came and sat beside me, and Flannigan, who had been sent down for more
      cups, passed tea, putting the tray on top of the chimney. Jim was sitting
      grumpily on the roof, with his feet folded under him, playing Canfield in
      the shadow of the parapet, buying the deck out of one pocket and putting
      his winnings in the other. He was watching Bella, too, and she knew it,
      and she strained a point to captivate Mr. Harbison. Any one could see
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was the picture that came out in the next morning&rsquo;s papers, tea
      cups, cards and all. For when some one looked up, there were four
      newspaper photographers on the roof of the next house, and they had the
      impertinence to thank us!
    </p>
    <p>
      Flannigan had seen Bella by that time, but as he still didn&rsquo;t understand
      the situation, things were just the same. But his manner to me puzzled me;
      whenever he came near me he winked prodigiously, and during all the search
      he kept one eye on me, and seemed to be amused about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rest had gone down to dress for dinner, which was being sent in,
      thank goodness, I still sat on the parapet and watched the darkening
      river. I felt terribly lonely, all at once, and sad. There wasn&rsquo;t any one
      any nearer than father, in the West, or mother in Bermuda, who really
      cared a rap whether I sat on that parapet all night or not, or who would
      be sorry if I leaped to the dirty bricks of the next door-yard&mdash;not
      that I meant to, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights came out across the river, and made purple and yellow streaks
      on the water, and one of the motor boats came panting back to the yacht
      club, coughing and gasping as if it had overdone. Down on the street
      automobiles were starting and stopping, cabs rolling, doors slamming, all
      the maddening, delightful bustle of people who are foot-free to dine out,
      to dance, to go to the theater, to do any of the thousand possibilities of
      a long February evening. And above them I sat on the roof and cried. Yes,
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was roused by some one coughing just behind me, and I tried to
      straighten my face before I turned. It was Flannigan, his double row of
      brass buttons gleaming in the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, miss,&rdquo; he said affably, &ldquo;but the boy from the hotel has left
      the dinner on the doorstep and run, the cowardly little divil! What&rsquo;ll I
      do with it? I went to Mrs. Wilson, but she says it&rsquo;s no concern of hers.&rdquo;
       Flannigan was evidently bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep it warm, Flannigan,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t wait; I&rsquo;m
      coming.&rdquo; But he did not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, miss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think ye&rsquo;d
      betther tell them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole thing&mdash;the joke,&rdquo; he said confidentially, coming closer.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been great sport, now, hasn&rsquo;t it? But I&rsquo;m afraid they will get on to
      it soon, and&mdash;some of them might not be agreeable. A pearl necklace
      is a pearl necklace, miss, and the lady&rsquo;s wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;why, Flannigan&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He merely grinned at me and thrust his hand down in his pocket. When he
      brought it up he had Bella&rsquo;s bracelet on his palm, glittering in the faint
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; Between relief and the absurdity of the thing, I
      was almost hysterical. But Flannigan did not give me the bracelet;
      instead, it struck me his tone was suddenly severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look here, miss,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve played your trick, and you&rsquo;ve had
      your fun. The Lord knows it&rsquo;s only folks like you would play April fool
      jokes with a fortune! If you&rsquo;re the sinsible little woman you look to be,
      you&rsquo;ll put that pearl collar on the coal in the basement tonight, and let
      me find it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got the pearl collar,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;I think you are crazy.
      Where did you get that bracelet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He edged away from me, as if he expected me to snatch it from him and run,
      but he was still trying in an elephantine way to treat the matter as a
      joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it in a drawer in the pantry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;among the dirty linen.
      And if you&rsquo;re as smart as I think you are, I&rsquo;ll find the pearl collar
      there in the morning&mdash;and nothing said, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So there I was, suspected of being responsible for Anne&rsquo;s pearl collar, as
      if I had not enough to worry me before. Of course I could have called them
      all together and told them, and made them explain to Flannigan what I had
      really meant by my delirious speech in the kitchen. But that would have
      meant telling the whole ridiculous story to Mr. Harbison, and having him
      think us all mad, and me a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all that overcrowded house there was only one place where I could be
      miserable with comfort. So I stayed on the roof, and cried a little and
      then became angry and walked up and down, and clenched my hands and
      babbled helplessly. The boats on the river were yellow, horizontal streaks
      through my tears, and an early searchlight sent its shaft like a tangible
      thing in the darkness, just over my head. Then, finally, I curled down in
      a corner with my arms on the parapet, and the lights became more and more
      prismatic and finally formed themselves into a circle that was Bella&rsquo;s
      bracelet, and that kept whirling around and around on something flat and
      not over-clean, that was Flannigan&rsquo;s palm.

    <h2>
      Chapter X. ON THE STAIRS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was roused by someone walking across the roof, the cracking of tin under
      feet, and a comfortable and companionable odor of tobacco. I moved a very
      little, and then I saw that it was a man&mdash;the height and erectness
      told me which man. And just at that instant he saw me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he ejaculated, and throwing his cigar away he came across
      quickly. &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Wilson, what in the world are you doing here? I
      thought&mdash;they said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I was sulking again?&rdquo; I finished disagreeably. &ldquo;Perhaps I am. In
      fact, I&rsquo;m quite sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not,&rdquo; he said severely. &ldquo;You have been asleep in a February
      night, in the open air, with less clothing on than I wear in the tropics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had got up by this time, refusing his help, and because my feet were
      numb, I sat down on the parapet for a moment. Oh, I knew what I looked
      like&mdash;one of those &ldquo;Valley-of-the-Nile-After-a-Flood&rdquo; pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing about you that is comforting,&rdquo; I sniffed. &ldquo;You said
      precisely the same thing to me at three o&rsquo;clock this morning. You never
      startle me by saying anything unexpected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a step toward me, and even in the dusk I could see that he was
      looking down at me oddly. All my bravado faded away and there was a
      queerish ringing in my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to!&rdquo; he said tensely. &ldquo;I would like, this minute&mdash;I&rsquo;m a
      fool, Mrs. Wilson,&rdquo; he finished miserably. &ldquo;I ought to be drawn and
      quartered, but when I see you like this I&mdash;I get crazy. If you say
      the word, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll go down and&mdash;&rdquo; He clenched his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was reprehensible, of course; he saw that in an instant, for he shut
      his teeth over something that sounded very fierce, and strode away from
      me, to stand looking out over the river, with his hands thrust in his
      pockets. Of course the thing I should have done was to ignore what he had
      said altogether, but he was so uncomfortable, so chastened, that, feline,
      feminine, whatever the instinct is, I could not let him go. I had been so
      wretched myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you would like to say?&rdquo; I called over to him. He did not
      speak. &ldquo;Would you tell me that I am a silly child for pouting?&rdquo; No reply;
      he struck a match. &ldquo;Or would you preach a nice little sermon about people&mdash;about
      women&mdash;loving their husbands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grunted savagely under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quite honest,&rdquo; I pursued relentlessly. &ldquo;Say that we are a lot of
      barbarians, say that because my&mdash;because Jimmy treats me outrageously&mdash;oh,
      he does; any one can see that&mdash;and because I loathe him&mdash;and any
      one can tell that&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you say you are shocked to the depths?&rdquo;
       I was a little shocked myself by that time, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop, having
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came over to me, white-faced and towering, and he had the audacity to
      grip my arm and stand me on my feet, like a bad child&mdash;which I was, I
      dare say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he said in a husky, very pained voice. &ldquo;You are only talking; you
      don&rsquo;t mean it. It isn&rsquo;t YOU. You know you care, or else why are you crying
      up here? And don&rsquo;t do it again, DON&rsquo;T DO IT AGAIN&mdash;or I will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make a fool of myself, as I have now,&rdquo; he finished grimly. And then he
      stalked away and left me there alone, completely bewildered, to find my
      way down in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      I groped along, holding to the rail, for the staircase to the roof was
      very steep, and I went slowly. Half-way down the stairs there was a tiny
      landing, and I stopped. I could have sworn I heard Mr. Harbison&rsquo;s
      footsteps far below, growing fainter. I even smiled a little, there in the
      dark, although I had been rather profoundly shaken. The next instant I
      knew I had been wrong; some one was on the landing with me. I could hear
      short, sharp breathing, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure that I struggled; in fact, I don&rsquo;t believe I did&mdash;I was
      too limp with amazement. The creature, to have lain in wait for me like
      that! And he was brutally strong; he caught me to him fiercely, and held
      me there, close, and he kissed me&mdash;not once or twice, but half a
      dozen times, long kisses that filled me with hot shame for him, for
      myself, that I had&mdash;liked him. The roughness of his coat bruised my
      cheek; I loathed him. And then someone came whistling along the hall
      below, and he pushed me from him and stood listening, breathing in long,
      gasping breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran; when my shaky knees would hold me, I ran. I wanted to hide my hot
      face, my disgust, my disillusion; I wanted to put my head in mother&rsquo;s lap
      and cry; I wanted to die, or be ill, so I need never see him again.
      Perversely enough, I did none of those things. With my face still flaming,
      with burning eyes and hands that shook, I made a belated evening toilet
      and went slowly, haughtily, down the stairs. My hands were like ice, but I
      was consumed with rage. Oh, I would show him&mdash;that this was New York,
      not Iquique; that the roof was not his Andean tableland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one elaborately ignored my absence from dinner. The Dallas Browns,
      Max and Lollie were at bridge; Jim was alone in the den, walking the floor
      and biting at an unlighted cigar; Betty had returned to Aunt Selina and
      was hysterical, they said, and Flannigan was in deep dejection because I
      had missed my dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty is making no end of a row,&rdquo; Max said, looking up from his game,
      &ldquo;because the old lady upstairs insists on chloroform liniment. Betty says
      the smell makes her ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she can inhale Russian cigarettes,&rdquo; Anne said enviously, &ldquo;and
      gasolene fumes, without turning a hair. I call a revoke, Dal; you trumped
      spades on the second round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dal flung over three tricks with very bad grace, and Anne counted them
      with maddening deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Game and rubber,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Watch Dal, Max; he will cheat in the score
      if he can. Kit, don&rsquo;t have another clam while I am in this house. I have
      eaten so many lately my waist rises and falls with the tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a stunning color, Kit,&rdquo; Lollie said. &ldquo;You are really quite
      superb. Who made that gown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been hiding, du kleine?&rdquo; Max whispered, under cover of
      showing me the evening paper, with a photograph of the house and a cross
      at the cellar window where we had tried to escape. &ldquo;If one day in the
      house with you, Kit, puts me in this condition, what will a month do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From beyond the curtain of a sort of alcove, lighted with a red-shaded
      lamp, came a hum of conversation, Bella&rsquo;s cool, even tones, and a heavy
      masculine voice. They were laughing; I could feel my chin go up. He was
      not even hiding his shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Max,&rdquo; I asked, while the others clamored for him and the game, &ldquo;has any
      one been up through the house since dinner? Any of the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Harbison,&rdquo; he replied promptly. &ldquo;Jim has been eating his heart out
      in the den every since dinner; Dal played the Sonata Appasionata backward
      on the pianola&mdash;he wanted to put through one of Anne&rsquo;s lingerie
      waists, on a wager that it would play a tune; I played craps with Lollie,
      and Flannigan has been washing dishes. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was conclusive, anyhow. I had had a faint hope that it might
      have been a joke, although it had borne all the evidences of sincerity,
      certainly. But it was past doubting now; he had lain in wait for me at the
      landing, and had kissed me, ME, when he thought I was Jimmy&rsquo;s wife. Oh, I
      must have been very light, very contemptible, if that was what he thought
      of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into the library and got a book, but it was impossible to read,
      with Jimmy lying on the couch giving vent to something between a sigh and
      a groan every few minutes. About eleven the cards stopped, and Bella said
      she would read palms. She began with Mr. Harbison, because she declared he
      had a wonderful hand, full of possibilities; she said he should have been
      a great inventor or a playwright, and that his attitude to women was one
      of homage, respect, almost reverence. He had the courage to look at me,
      and if a glance could have killed he would have withered away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jimmy proffered his hand, she looked at it icily. Of course she could
      not refuse, with Mr. Harbison looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather negative,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;The lines are obscured by cushions of
      flesh; no heart line at all, mentality small, self-indulgence and
      irritability very marked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim held his palm up to the light and stared at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hardly safe for me to go around without gloves, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all well enough for Jim to laugh, but he was horribly hurt. He
      stood around for a few minutes, talking to Anne, but as soon as he could
      he slid away and went to bed. He looked very badly the next morning, as
      though he had not slept, and his clothes quite hung on him. He was
      actually thinner. But that is ahead of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max came to me while the others were sitting around drinking nightcaps,
      and asked me in a low tone if he could see me in the den; he wanted to ask
      me something. Dal overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask her here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We all know what it is, Max. Go ahead and we&rsquo;ll
      coach you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you coach ME?&rdquo; I asked, for Mr. Harbison was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman does not need it,&rdquo; Dal retorted. And then, because Max looked
      angry enough really to propose to me right there, I got up hastily and
      went into the den. Max followed, and closing the door, stood with his back
      against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contrary to the general belief, Kit,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I did NOT intend to ask
      you to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I breathed easier. He took a couple of steps toward me and stood with his
      arms folded, looking down at me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure, in fact, that I
      shall ever propose to you,&rdquo; he went on unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already done it twice. You are not going to take those back, are
      you, Max?&rdquo; I asked, looking up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Max was not to be cajoled. He came close and stood with his hand on
      the back of my chair. &ldquo;What happened on the roof tonight?&rdquo; He demanded
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think it would interest you,&rdquo; I retorted, coloring in spite of
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not interest me! I am shut in this blasted house; I have to see the only
      woman I ever loved&mdash;REALLY loved,&rdquo; he supplemented, as he caught my
      eye, &ldquo;pretend she is another man&rsquo;s wife. Then I sit back and watch her
      using every art&mdash;all her beauty&mdash;to make still another man love
      her, a man who thinks she is a married woman. If Harbison were worth the
      trouble, I would tell him the whole story, Aunt Selina be&mdash;obliterated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat up suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Harbison were worth the trouble!&rdquo; I repeated. What did he mean? Had he
      seen&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean just this,&rdquo; Max said slowly. &ldquo;There is only one unaccredited
      member of this household; only one person, save Flannigan, who was locked
      in the furnace room, one person who was awake and around the house when
      Anne&rsquo;s jewels went, only one person in the house, also, who would have any
      motive for the theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Motive?&rdquo; I asked dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poverty,&rdquo; Max threw at me. &ldquo;Oh, I mean comparative poverty, of course.
      Who is this fellow, anyhow? Dal knew him at school, traveled with him
      through India. On the strength of that he brings him here, quarters him
      with decent people, and wonders when they are systematically robbed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unjust!&rdquo; I said, rising and facing him. &ldquo;I do not like Mr.
      Harbison&mdash;I&mdash;I hate him, if you want to know. But as to his
      being a thief, I&mdash;think it is quite as likely that you took the
      necklace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max threw his cigarette into the fire angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is how it is!&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;If either of us is the thief, it is I!
      You DO hate him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him there, flushed with irritation, and joined the others. Just as
      I entered the room, Betty burst through the hall door like a cyclone, and
      collapsed into a chair. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a mean, cantankerous old woman!&rdquo; she
      declared, feeling for her handkerchief. &ldquo;You can take care of your own
      Aunt Selina, Jim Wilson. I will never go near her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do? Poison her?&rdquo; Dallas asked with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G&mdash;got camphor in her eyes,&rdquo; snuffed Betty. &ldquo;You never&mdash;heard
      such a noise. I wouldn&rsquo;t be a trained nurse for anything in the world. She&mdash;she
      called me a hussy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to give her up, are you, Betty?&rdquo; Jim asked imploringly.
      But Betty was, and said so plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, she won&rsquo;t have me back,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;and she has sent for&mdash;guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have mercy!&rdquo; Dal cried, dropping to his knees. &ldquo;Oh, fair ministering
      angel, she has not sent for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Betty said maliciously. &ldquo;She wants Bella&mdash;she&rsquo;s crazy about
      her.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XI. I MAKE A DISCOVERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Really, I have left Aunt Selina rather out of it, but she was important as
      a cause, not as a result; at least at first. She came out strong later. I
      believe she was a very nice old woman, with strong likes and prejudices,
      which she was perfectly willing to pay for. At least, I only presume she
      had likes; I know she had prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody every understood why Bella consented to take Betty&rsquo;s place with
      Aunt Selina. As for me, I was too much engrossed with my own affairs to
      pay the invalid much attention. Once or twice during the day I had stopped
      in to see her, and had been received frigidly and with marked disapproval.
      I was in disgrace, of course, after the scene in the dining room the night
      before. I had stood like a naughty child, just inside the door, and
      replied meekly when she said the pillows were overstuffed, and why didn&rsquo;t
      I have the linen slips rinsed in starch water? She laid the blame of her
      illness on me, as I have said before, and she made Jim read to her in the
      afternoon from a book she carried with her, Coals of Fire on the DOMESTIC
      Hearth, marking places for me to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent for me that night, just as I had taken off my gown; so I threw on
      a dressing gown and went in. To my horror, Jim was already there. At a
      gesture from Aunt Selina, he closed the door into the hall and tiptoed
      back beside the bed, where he sat staring at the figures on the silk
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina&rsquo;s first words were:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that flibberty-gibbet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must mean Betty,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;She has gone to bed, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;let&mdash;her&mdash;in&mdash;this&mdash;room&mdash;again,&rdquo;
       she said, with awful emphasis. &ldquo;She is an infamous creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now, Aunt Selina,&rdquo; Jim broke in; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s foolish, perhaps, but
      she&rsquo;s a nice little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina&rsquo;s face was a curious study. Then she raised herself on her
      elbow, and, taking a flat chamois-skin bag from under her pillow, held it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My cameo breastpin,&rdquo; she said solemnly; &ldquo;my cuff-buttons with gold rims
      and storks painted on china in the middle; my watch, that has put me to
      bed and got me up for forty years, and my money&mdash;five hundred and ten
      dollars and forty cents!&mdash;taken with the doors locked under my nose.&rdquo;
       Which was ambiguous, but forcible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, good gracious, Miss Car&mdash;Aunt Selina!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      think Betty Mercer took those things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said grimly; &ldquo;I think I probably got up in my sleep and lighted
      the fire with them, or sent em out for a walk.&rdquo; Then she stuffed the bag
      away and sat up resolutely in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made up?&rdquo; she demanded, looking from one to the other of us.
      &ldquo;Bella, don&rsquo;t tell me you still persist in that nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense?&rdquo; I asked, getting ready to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you do not love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James,&rdquo; she snapped irritably. &ldquo;Do you suppose I mean the policeman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked over at Jimmy. She had got me by the hand, and Jimmy was making
      frantic gestures to tell her the whole thing and be done with it. But I
      had gone too far. The mill of the gods had crushed me already, and I
      didn&rsquo;t propose to be drawn out hideously mangled and held up as an example
      for the next two or three weeks, although it was clear enough that Aunt
      Selina disapproved of me thoroughly, and would have been glad enough to
      find that no tie save the board of health held us together. And then Bella
      came in, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have known her. She had put on a straight white
      woolen wrapper, and she had her hair in two long braids down her back. She
      looked like a nice, wide-eyed little girl in her teens, and she had some
      lobster salad and a glass of port on a tray. When she saw the situation,
      she put the things down and had the nastiness to stay and listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blind,&rdquo; Aunt Selina said, with one eye on the tray. &ldquo;You two
      silly children adore each other; I saw some things last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella took a step forward; then she stopped and shrugged her shoulders.
      Jim was purple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you kiss her in the dining room, remember that!&rdquo; Aunt Selina went
      on, giving the screw another turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Bella&rsquo;s turn to be excited. She gave me one awful stare, then she
      fixed her eyes on Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Aunt Selina went on, &ldquo;you told me today that you loved her.
      Don&rsquo;t deny it, James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet another instant. She came over and stood at the
      foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t excite yourself, DEAR Miss Caruthers,&rdquo; she said in a voice
      like ice. &ldquo;Every one knows that he loves her; he simply overflows with it.
      It&mdash;it is quite a by-word among their friends. They have been sitting
      together in a corner all evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was what she said; when I had not spoken to Jimmy the whole time
      in the den. Bella was cattish, and she was jealous, too. I turned on my
      heel and went to the door; then I turned to her, with my hand on the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been misinformed,&rdquo; I said coldly. &ldquo;You can not possibly know,
      having spent three hours in a corner yourself&mdash;with Mr. Harbison.&rdquo; I
      abhor jealousy in a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Aunt Selina ate all the lobster salad, and drank the port after
      Bella had told her it was beef, iron and wine, and she slept all night,
      and was able to sit up in a chair the next day, and was so infatuated with
      Bella that she would not let her out of her sight. But that is ahead of
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the house was fairly quiet, except for Jim, who kept walking
      around the halls because he couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I got up at last and ordered
      him to bed, and he had the audacity to have a grievance with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at my situation now!&rdquo; he said, sitting pensively on a steam
      radiator. &ldquo;Aunt Selina is crazy. I only kissed your hand, anyhow, and I
      don&rsquo;t know why you sat in the den all evening; you might have known that
      Bella would notice it. Why couldn&rsquo;t you leave me alone to my misery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said, much offended. &ldquo;After this I shall sit with Flannigan
      in the kitchen. He is the only gentleman in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him babbling apologies and went to bed, but I had an uncomfortable
      feeling that Bella had been a witness to our conversation, for the door
      into Aunt Selina&rsquo;s room closed softly as I passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew beforehand that I was not going to sleep. The instant I turned out
      the light the nightmare events of the evening ranged themselves in a
      procession, or a series of tableaus, one after the other; Flannigan on the
      roof, with the bracelet on his palm, looking accusingly at me; Mr.
      Harbison and the scene on the roof, with my flippancy; and the result of
      that flippancy&mdash;the man on the stairs, the arms that held me, the
      terrible kisses that had scorched my lips&mdash;it was awful! And then the
      absurd situation across Aunt Selina&rsquo;s bed, and Bella&rsquo;s face! Oh, it was
      all so ridiculous&mdash;my having thought that the Harbison man was a
      gentleman, and finding him a cad, and worse. It was excruciatingly funny.
      I quite got a headache from laughing; indeed I laughed until I found I was
      crying, and then I knew I was going to have an attack of strangulated
      emotion, called hysteria. So I got up and turned on all the lights, and
      bathed my face with cologne, and felt better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not go to sleep. When the hall clock chimed two, I discovered I
      was hungry. I had had nothing since luncheon, and even the thirst
      following the South American goulash was gone. There was probably
      something to eat in the pantry, and if there was not, I was quite equal to
      going to the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, however, I found a very orderly assortment of left-overs
      and a pitcher of milk, which had no business there in the pantry, and with
      plenty of light I was not at all frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ate bread and butter and drank milk, and was fast becoming a rational
      person again; I had pulled out one of the drawers part way, and with a
      tray across the corner I had improvised a comfortable seat. And then I
      noticed that the drawer was full of soiled napkins, and I remembered the
      bracelet. I hardly know why I decided to go through the drawer again,
      after Flannigan had already done it, but I did. I finished my milk and
      then, getting down on my knees, I proceeded systematically to empty the
      drawer. I took out perhaps a dozen napkins and as many doilies without
      finding anything. Then I took out a large tray cloth, and there was
      something on it that made me look farther. One corner of it had been
      scorched, the clear and well defined imprint of a lighted cigarette or
      cigar, a blackened streak that trailed off into a brown and yellow. I had
      a queer, trembly feeling, as if I were on the brink of a discovery&mdash;perhaps
      Anne&rsquo;s pearls, or the cuff buttons with storks painted on china in the
      center. But the only thing I found, down in the corner of the drawer, was
      a half-burned cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, it seemed quite enough. It was one of the South American
      cigarettes, with a tobacco wrapper instead of paper, that Mr. Harbison
      smoked.

      Chapter XII. THE ROOF GARDEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was quite ill the next morning&mdash;from excitement, I suppose. Anyhow,
      I did not get up, and there wasn&rsquo;t any breakfast. Jim said he roused
      Flannigan at eight o&rsquo;clock, to go down and get the fire started, and then
      went back to bed. But Flannigan did not get up. He appeared, sheepishly,
      at half-past ten, and by that time Bella was down, in a towering rage, and
      had burned her hand and got the fire started, and had taken up a tray for
      Aunt Selina and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the others straggled down they boiled themselves eggs or ate fruit, and
      nobody put anything away. Lollie Mercer made me some tea and scorched
      toast, and brought it, about eleven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw such a house,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;A dozen housemaids couldn&rsquo;t put
      it in order. Why should every man that smokes drop ashes wherever he
      happens to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question of the ages,&rdquo; I replied languidly. &ldquo;What was Max
      talking so horribly about a little while ago?&rdquo; Lollie looked up aggrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About nothing at all,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Anne told me to clean the bath tubs
      with oil, and I did it, that&rsquo;s all. Now Max says he couldn&rsquo;t get it off,
      and his clothes stick to him, and if he should forget and strike a match
      in the&mdash;in the usual way, he would explode. He can clean his own tub
      tomorrow,&rdquo; she finished vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon Jim came in to see me, bringing Anne as a concession to Bella. He
      was in a rage, and he carried the morning paper like a club in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a newspaper lie would you call this?&rdquo; he demanded irritably.
      &ldquo;It makes me crazy; everybody with a mental image of me leaning over the
      parapet of the roof, waving a board, with the rest of you sitting on my
      legs to keep me from overbalancing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe there&rsquo;s a picture!&rdquo; Anne said hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No picture,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I wonder why they restrained themselves! I
      wish Bella would keep off the roof,&rdquo; he added, with fresh access of rage,
      &ldquo;or wear a mask or veil. One of those fellows is going to recognize her,
      and there&rsquo;ll be the deuce to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are all through discussing this thing, perhaps you will tell me
      what is the matter,&rdquo; I remarked from my couch. &ldquo;Why did you lean over the
      parapet, Jim, and who sat on your legs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t; nobody did,&rdquo; he retorted, waving the newspaper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie out
      of the whole cloth, that&rsquo;s what it is. I asked you girls to be decent to
      those reporters; it never pays to offend a newspaper man. Listen to this,
      Kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read the article rapidly, furiously, pausing every now and then to make
      an exasperated comment.

    <p>
      ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE FRUSTRATED MEMBERS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED DEFY THE LAW
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Special Officer McCloud, on duty at the quarantined house of James
      Wilson, artist and clubman, on Ninety-fifth Street, reported this morning
      a daring attempt at escape, made at 3 A.M. It is in this house that some
      eight or nine members of the smart set were imprisoned during the course
      of a dinner party, when the Japanese butler developed smallpox. The party
      shut in the house includes Miss Katherine McNair, the daughter of Theodore
      McNair, of the Inter-Ocean system; Mr. and Mrs. Dallas Brown; the Misses
      Mercer; Maxwell Reed, the well-known clubman and whip; and a Mr. Thomas
      Harbison, guest of the Dallas Browns and a South American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officer McCloud&rsquo;s story, told to a Chronicle reporter this morning, is as
      follows: The occupants of the house had been uneasy all day. From the air
      of subdued bustle, and from a careful inspection of the roof, made by the
      entire party during the afternoon, his suspicion had been aroused. Nothing
      unusual, however, occurred during the early part of the night. From eight
      o&rsquo;clock to twelve, McCloud was relieved from duty, his place being taken
      by Michael Shane, of the Eighty-sixth Street Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When McCloud came on duty at midnight, Shane reported that about eleven
      o&rsquo;clock the searchlight of a steamer on the river, flashing over the
      house, had shown a man crouching on the parapet, evidently surveying the
      roof across, which at this point is only twelve feet distant, with a view
      of making his escape. One seeing Shane below, however, he had beat a
      retreat, but not before the officer had seen him distinctly. He was
      dressed in evening clothes and wore a light tan overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officer McCloud relieved Shane at midnight, and sent for a plain-clothes
      man from the station house. This man was stationed on the roof of the
      Bevington residence next door, with strict injunctions to prevent an
      escape from the quarantined mansion. Nothing suspicious having occurred,
      the man on the roof left about 3 A.M., reporting to McCloud below that
      everything was quiet. At that moment, glancing skyward, one of the
      officers was astounded to see a long narrow board project itself from the
      coping of the Wildon house, waver uncertainly for a moment, and then
      advance stealthily toward the parapet across. When it was within a foot or
      two of a resting place, McCloud called sharply to the invisible refugee
      above, at the same time firing his revolver in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The result was surprising. The board stopped, trembled, swayed a little,
      and dropped, missing the vigilant officers by a hair&rsquo;s breadth, and
      crashing to the cement with a terrific force. An inspection of the roof
      from the Bevington house, later, revealed nothing unusual. It is evident,
      however, that the quarantine is proving irksome to the inhabitants of the
      sequestered residence, most of whom are typical society folk, without
      resources in themselves. Their condition, without valets and maids, is
      certainly pitiable. It has been rumored that the ladies are doing their
      own hair, and that the gentlemen have been reduced to putting their own
      buttons in their shirts. This deplorable situation, however, is
      unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vigilance of the board of health has been most commendable in this
      case. Beginning with a wager over the telephone that they would break
      quarantine in twenty-four hours, and ending with the attempt to span a
      twelve-foot gulf with a board, over which to cross to freedom, these
      shut-in society folk have shown characteristic disregard of the laws of
      the state. It is quite time to extend to the millionaire the same
      strictness that keeps the commuter at home for three weeks with the
      measles; that makes him get the milk bottles and groceries from the gate
      post and smell like dog soap for a month afterward, as a result of
      disinfection.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat in dead silence for a minute. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is true,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Not of you, Jim&mdash;but some one may have
      tried to get out that way. In fact, I think it extremely likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Flannigan? You couldn&rsquo;t drive him out. He&rsquo;s having the time of his
      life. Do you suspect me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away and don&rsquo;t fight,&rdquo; Anne broke in pacifically. &ldquo;You will have to
      have luncheon sent in, Jimmy; nobody has ordered anything from the shops,
      and I feel like old Mother Hubbard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would all go out,&rdquo; I said wearily. &ldquo;If every man in the house
      says he didn&rsquo;t try to get over to the next roof last night, well and good.
      But you might look and see if the board is still lying where it fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an instantaneous rush for the window, and a second&rsquo;s pause. Then
      Jimmy&rsquo;s voice, incredulous, awed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;blessed! There&rsquo;s the board!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stayed in my room all that day. My head really ached and then, too, I
      did not care to meet Mr. Harbison. It would have to come; I realized that
      a meeting was inevitable, but I wanted time to think how I would meet him.
      It would be impossible to cut him, without rousing the curiosity of the
      others to fever pitch; and it was equally impossible to ignore the
      disgraceful episode on the stairs. As it happened, however, I need not
      have worried. I went down to dinner, languidly, when every one was seated,
      and found Max at my right, and Mr. Harbison moved over beside Bella. Every
      one was talking at once, for Flannigan, ambling around the table as airily
      as he walked his beat, had presented Bella with her bracelet on a salad
      plate, garnished with romaine. He had found it in the furnace room, he
      said, where she must have dropped it. And he looked at me stealthily, to
      approve his mendacity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was famished, and as they ate they discussed the board in the
      area way, and pretended to deride it as a clever bit of press work, to
      revive a dying sensation. No one was deceived; Anne&rsquo;s pearls and the
      attempt to escape, coming just after, pointed only to one thing. I looked
      around the table, dazed. Flannigan, almost the only unknown quantity,
      might have tried to escape the night before, but he would not have been in
      dress clothes. Besides, he must be eliminated as far as the pearls were
      concerned, having been locked in the furnace room the night they were
      stolen. There was no one among the girls to suspect. The Mercer girls had
      stunning pearls, and could secure all they wanted legitimately; and Bella
      disliked them. Oh, there was no question about it, I decided; Dallas and
      Anne had taken a wolf to their bosom&mdash;or is it a viper?&mdash;and the
      Harbison man was the creature. Although I must say that, looking over the
      table, at Jimmy&rsquo;s breadth and not very imposing personality, at Max&rsquo;s lean
      length, sallow skin, and bold dark eyes, at Dallas, blond, growing bald
      and florid, and then at the Harbison boy, tall, muscular, clear-eyed and
      sunburned, one would have taken Max at first choice as the villain, with
      Dal next, Jim third, and the Harbison boy not in the running.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just after dinner that the surprise was sprung on me. Mr. Harbison
      came around to me gravely, and asked me if I felt able to go up on the
      roof. On the roof, after last night! I had to gather myself together;
      luckily, the others were pushing back their chairs, showing Flannigan the
      liqueur glasses to take up, and lighting cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care to go,&rdquo; I said icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The others are coming,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;and I&mdash;I could give you an
      arm up the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are good at that,&rdquo; I said, looking at him steadily. &ldquo;Max,
      will you help me to the roof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison really turned rather white. Then he bowed ceremoniously and
      left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max got me a wrap, and every one except Mr. Harbison and Bella, who was
      taking a mass of indigestables to Aunt Selina, went to the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Tom?&rdquo; Anne asked, as we reached the foot of the stairs. &ldquo;Gone
      ahead to fix things,&rdquo; was the answer. But he was not there. At the top of
      the last flight I stopped, dumb with amazement; the roof had been
      transformed, enchanted. It was a fairy-land of lights and foliage and
      colors. I had to stop and rub my eyes. From the bleakness of a tin roof in
      February to the brightness and greenery of a July roof garden!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were the immediate inspiration, Kit,&rdquo; Dallas said. &ldquo;Harbison thought
      your headache might come from lack of exercise and fresh air, and he has
      worked us like nailers all day. I&rsquo;ve a blister on my right palm, and
      Harbison got shocked while he was wiring the place, and nearly fell over
      the parapet. We bought out two full-sized florists by telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the most amazing transformation. At each corner a pole had been
      erected, and wires crossed the roof diagonally, hung with red and amber
      bulbs. Around the chimneys had been massed evergreen trees in tubs, hiding
      their brick-and-mortar ugliness, and among the trees tiny lights were
      strung. Along the parapet were rows of geometrical boxwood plants in
      bright red crocks, and the flaps of a crimson and white tent had been
      thrown open, showing lights within, and rugs, wicker chairs, and cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max raised a glass of benedictine and posed for a moment,
      melodramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Wilson roof garden!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To Kit, who inspired; to the
      creators, who perspired; and to Takahiro&mdash;may he not have expired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one was very gay; I think the knowledge that tomorrow Aunt Selina
      might be with them urged them to make the most of this last night of
      freedom. I tried to be jolly, and succeeded in being feverish. Mr.
      Harbison did not come up to enjoy what he had wrought. Jim brought up his
      guitar and sang love songs in a beautiful tenor, looking at Bella all the
      time. And Bella sat in a steamer chair, with a rug over her and a spangled
      veil on her head, looking at the boats on the river&mdash;about as soft
      and as chastened as an an acetylene headlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after Max had told the most improbable tale, which Leila advised him
      to sprinkle salt on, and Dallas had done a clog dance, Bella said it was
      time for her complexion sleep and went downstairs, and broke up the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she only give half as an much care to her immortal soul,&rdquo; Anne said
      when she had gone, &ldquo;as she does to her skin, she would let that nice
      Harbison boy alone. She must have been brutal to him tonight, for he went
      to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock. At least, I suppose he went to bed, for he shut
      himself in the studio, and when I knocked he advised me not to come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had pleaded my headache as an excuse for avoiding Aunt Selina all day,
      and she had not sent for me. Bella was really quite extraordinary. She was
      never in the habit of putting herself out for any one, and she always
      declared that the very odor of a sick room drove her to Scotch and soda.
      But here she was, rubbing Aunt Selina&rsquo;s back with chloroform liniment&mdash;and
      you know how that smells&mdash;getting her up in a chair, dressed in one
      of Bella&rsquo;s wadded silk robes, with pillows under her feet, and then doing
      her hair in elaborate puffs&mdash;braiding her gray switch and bringing
      it, coronet-fashion, around the top of her head. She even put rice powder
      on Aunt Selina&rsquo;s nose, and dabbed violet water behind her ears, and said
      she couldn&rsquo;t understand why she (Aunt Selina) had never married, but, of
      course, she probably would some day!
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was, naturally, that the old lady wouldn&rsquo;t let Bella out of her
      sight, except to go to the kitchen for something to eat for her. That very
      day Bella got the doctor to order ale for Aunt Selina (oh, yes; the doctor
      could come in; Dal said &ldquo;it was all a-coming in, and nothing going out&rdquo;)
      and she had three pints of Bass, and learned to eat anchovies and caviare&mdash;all
      in one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella&rsquo;s conduct to Jim was disgraceful. She snubbed him, ignored him,
      tramped on him, and Jim was growing positively flabby. He spent most of
      his time writing letters to the board of health and playing solitaire. He
      was a pathetic figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we went to bed fairly early. Bella had massaged Aunt Selina&rsquo;s face
      and rubbed in cold cream, Anne and Dallas had compromised on which window
      should be open in their bedroom, and the men had matched to see who should
      look at the furnace. I did not expect to sleep, but the cold night air had
      done its work, and I was asleep almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time during the early part of the night I wakened, and, after turning
      and twisting uneasily, I realized that I was cold. The couch in Bella&rsquo;s
      dressing room was comfortable enough, but narrow and low. I remember
      distinctly (that was what was so maddening; everybody thought I dreamed
      it)&mdash;I remember getting an eiderdown comfort that was folded at my
      feet, and pulling it up around me. In the luxury of its warmth I snuggled
      down and went to sleep almost instantly. It seemed to me I had slept for
      hours, but it was probably an hour or less, when something roused me. The
      room was perfectly dark, and there was not a sound save the faint ticking
      of the clock, but I was wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the incident that in its ghastly, horrible absurdity made
      the rest of the people shout with laughter the next day. It was not funny
      then. For suddenly the eiderdown comfort began to slip. I heard no
      footstep, not the slightest sound approaching me, but the comfort moved;
      from my chin, inch by inch, it slipped to my shoulders; awfully,
      inevitably, hair-raisingly it moved. I could feel my blood gather around
      my heart, leaving me cold and nerveless. As it passed my hands I gave an
      involuntary clutch for it, to feel it slip away from my fingers. Then the
      full horror of the situation took hold of me; as the comfort slid past my
      feet I sat up and screamed at the top of my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, people came running in all sorts of things. I was still sitting
      up, declaring I had seen a ghost and that the house was haunted. Dallas
      was struggling for the second armhole of his dressing gown and Bella had
      already turned on the lights. They said I had had a nightmare, and not to
      sleep on my back, and perhaps I was taking grippe.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just then we heard Jimmy run down the stairs, and fall over something,
      almost breaking his wrist. It was the eiderdown comfort, half-way up the
      studio staircase!

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII. HE DOES NOT DENY IT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina got up the next morning and Jim told her all the strange
      things that had been happening. She fixed on Flannigan, of course,
      although she still suspected Betty of her watch and other valuables. The
      incident of the comfort she called nervous indigestion and bad hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent the entire day going through the storeroom and linen closets,
      and running her fingers over things for dust. Whenever she found any she
      looked at me, drew a long breath, and said, &ldquo;Poor James!&rdquo; It was
      maddening. And when she went through his clothes and found some buttons
      off (Jim didn&rsquo;t keep a man, and Takahiro had stopped at his boots) she
      looked at me quite awfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother was a perfect housekeeper,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;James was brought up in
      clothes with the buttons on, put on clean shelves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they put them on him?&rdquo; I asked, almost hysterically. It had been a
      bad morning, after a worse night. Every one had found fault with the
      breakfast, and they straggled down one at a time until I was frantic. Then
      Flannigan had talked to me about the pearls, and Mr. Harbison had said,
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; very stiffly, and nearly rattled the inside of the furnace
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning, too, I overheard a scrap of conversation between the
      policeman and our gentleman adventurer from South America. Something had
      gone wrong with the telephone and Mr. Harbison was fussing over it with a
      screw driver and a pair of scissors&mdash;all the tools he could find.
      Flannigan was lifting rugs to shake them on the roof&mdash;Bella&rsquo;s order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wash the table linen!&rdquo; he was grumbling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can that&rsquo;s
      necessary. Grub has to be cooked, and dishes has to be washed&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      admit that. If you&rsquo;re particular, make up your bed every day; I don&rsquo;t
      object. But don&rsquo;t tell me we have to use thirty-three table napkins a day.
      What did folks do before napkins was invented? Tell me that!&rdquo;&mdash;triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo; Mr. Harbison inquired absently, evidently with the
      screw driver in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Used their pocket handkerchiefs! And if the worst comes to the worst, Mr.
      Harbison, these folks here can use their sleeves, for all I care&mdash;not
      that the women has any sleeves to speak of. Wash clothes I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t worry Mrs. Wilson about it,&rdquo; the other voice said. Flannigan
      straightened himself with a grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilson!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A lot she would worry. She&rsquo;s been a
      disappointment to me, Mr. Harbison, me thinking that now she&rsquo;d come back
      to him, after leavin&rsquo; him the way she did, they&rsquo;d be like two turtle
      doves. Lord! The cook next door&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But what the cook had told about Bella and Jimmy was not divulged, for the
      Harbison man caught him up with a jerk and sent Flannigan, grumbling, with
      his rugs to the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not seem possible to carry on the deception much longer, but if
      things were bad now, what would they be when Aunt Selina learned she had
      been lied to, made ridiculous, generally deceived? And how would I be able
      to live in the house with her when she did know? Luckily, every one was so
      puzzled over the mystery in the house that numbers of little things that
      would have been absolutely damning were never noticed at all. For
      instance, my asking Jimmy at luncheon that day if he took cream in his
      coffee! And Max coming to the rescue by dropping his watch in his glass of
      water, and creating a diversion and giving everybody an opportunity to
      laugh by saying not to mind, it had been in soak before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after luncheon Aunt Selina brought me some undergarments of Jim&rsquo;s to
      be patched. She explained at length that he had always worn out his
      undergarments, because he always squirmed around so when he was sitting.
      And she showed me how to lay one of the garments over a pillow to get the
      patch in properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most humiliating moment of my life, but there was no escape. I
      took my sewing to the roof, while she went away to find something else for
      me to do when that was finished, and I sat with the thing on my knee and
      stared at it, while rebellious tears rolled down my cheeks. The patch was
      not the shape of the hole at all, and every time I took a stitch I sewed
      it fast to the pillow beneath. It was terrible. Jim came up after a while
      and sat down across from me and watched, without saying anything. I
      suppose what he felt would not have been proper to say to me. We had both
      reached the point where adequate language failed us. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; I retorted, jerking the thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for more of these.&rdquo; I indicated the garment over the pillow, and
      he wiggled. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t squirm,&rdquo; I said coldly. &ldquo;You will wear out your&mdash;lingerie,
      and I will have to mend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat very still for five minutes, when I discovered that I had put the
      patch in crosswise instead of lengthwise and that it would not fit. As I
      jerked it out he sneezed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or sneeze,&rdquo; I added venomously. &ldquo;You will tear your buttons off, and I
      will have to sew them on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim rose wrathfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit, don&rsquo;t sneeze,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand,
      I suppose, for fear I will wear out my socks. Here, give me that. If the
      fool thing has to be mended, I&rsquo;ll do it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went over to a corner of the parapet and turned his back to me. He was
      very much offended. In about a minute he came back, triumphant, and held
      out the result of his labor. I could only gasp. He had puckered up the
      edges of the hole like the neck of a bag, and had tied the thread around
      it. &ldquo;You&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be able to sit down,&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have any time to sit,&rdquo; he retorted promptly. &ldquo;Anyhow, it will give
      some, won&rsquo;t it? It would if it was tied with elastic instead of thread.
      Have you any elastic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lollie came up just then, and Jim took himself and his mending downstairs.
      Luckily, Aunt Selina found several letters in his room that afternoon
      while she was going over his clothes, and as it took Jim some time to
      explain them, she forgot the task she had given me altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lollie came up to the roof, she closed the door to the stairs, and
      coming over, drew a chair close to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen much of Tom today?&rdquo; she asked, as an introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean Mr. Harbison, Lollie,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No&mdash;not any more
      than I could help. Don&rsquo;t whisper, he couldn&rsquo;t possibly hear you. And if
      it&rsquo;s scandal I don&rsquo;t want to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Kit,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t be so superior. If I like to
      talk scandal, I&rsquo;m not so sure you aren&rsquo;t making it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the way right along: I was making scandal; I brought them there
      to dinner; I let Bella in!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, Anne came up then, and began on me at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very bad girl,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;What do you mean by treating Tom
      Harbison the way you do? He is heart-broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you exaggerate my influence over him,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      treated him badly, because I haven&rsquo;t paid any attention to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne threw up her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He worked all day yesterday fixing this place
      for you&mdash;yes, for you, my dear. I am not blind&mdash;and last night
      you refused to let him bring you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told you!&rdquo; I flamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wondered what he had done. And as you wouldn&rsquo;t let him come within
      speaking distance of you, he came to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Anne, since you are fond of him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But to me he is
      impossible&mdash;intolerable. My reasons are quite sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kit is perfectly right, Anne,&rdquo; Leila broke in. &ldquo;I tell you, there is
      something queer about him,&rdquo; she added in a portentous whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is perfect,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Of good family, warm-hearted, courageous,
      handsome, clever&mdash;what more do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honesty,&rdquo; said Leila hotly. &ldquo;That a man should be what he says he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne and I both stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your Mr. Harbison,&rdquo; Leila went on, &ldquo;who tried to escape from the
      house by putting a board across to the next roof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;You might bring me a picture of him,
      board in hand, and I wouldn&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t then,&rdquo; Lollie said cruelly. &ldquo;Let him get away with your pearls;
      they are yours. Only, as sure as anything, the man who tried to escape
      from the house had a reason for escaping, and the papers said a man in
      evening dress and light overcoat. I found Mr. Harbison&rsquo;s overcoat today
      lying in a heap in one of the maids&rsquo; rooms, and it was covered with brick
      dust all over the front. A button had even been torn off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; Anne said, when she had recovered herself a little. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
      any reason, as far as that goes, why Flannigan shouldn&rsquo;t have worn Tom&rsquo;s
      overcoat, or&mdash;any of the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flannigan!&rdquo; Leila said loftily. &ldquo;Why, his arms are like piano legs; he
      couldn&rsquo;t get into it. As for the others, there is only one person who
      would fit, or nearly fit, that overcoat, and that is Dallas, Anne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Anne was choking down her wrath, Leila got up and darted out of the
      tent. When she came back she was triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand. And on her palm lay a lightish
      brown button. &ldquo;I found it just where the paper said the board was thrown
      out, and it is from Mr. Harbison&rsquo;s overcoat, without a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I should not have been surprised. A man who would kiss a woman
      on a dark staircase&mdash;a woman he had known only two days&mdash;was
      capable of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kit has only been a little keener than the rest of us,&rdquo; Lollie said. &ldquo;She
      found him out yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Anne indignantly, preparing to go, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t know
      you girls so well, I would think you were crazy. And now, just to offset
      this, I can tell you something. Flannigan told me this morning not to
      worry; that he has my pearl collar spotted, and that YOUNG LADIES WILL
      HAVE THEIR JOKES!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, as I said before, it was a cheerful, joy-producing situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat and thought it over after Anne&rsquo;s parting shot, when Leila had
      flounced downstairs. Things were closing in; I gave the situation
      twenty-four hours to develop. At the end of that time Flannigan would
      accuse me openly of knowing where the pearls were; I would explain my
      silly remark to him and the mine would explode&mdash;under Aunt Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sunk in dejected reverie when some one came on the roof. When he was
      opposite the opening in the tent, I saw Mr. Harbison, and at that moment
      he saw me. He paused uncertainly, then he made an evident effort and came
      over to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are&mdash;better today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you find the tent useful. Does it keep off the wind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite a shelter&rdquo;&mdash;frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still stood, struggling for something to say. Evidently nothing came to
      his mind, for he lifted the cap he was wearing, and turning away, began to
      work with the wiring of the roof. He was clever with tools; one could see
      that. If he was a professional gentleman-burglar, no doubt he needed to
      be. After a bit, finding it necessary to climb to the parapet, he took off
      his coat, without even a glance in my direction, and fell to work
      vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      One does not need to like a man to admire him physically, any more than
      one needs to like a race horse or any other splendid animal. No one could
      deny that the man on the parapet was a splendid animal; he looked quite
      big enough and strong enough to have tossed his slender bridge across the
      gulf to the next roof, without any difficulty, and coordinate enough to
      have crossed on it with a flourish to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a rending, tearing sound from the corner and a
      muttered ejaculation. I looked up in time to see Mr. Harbison throw up his
      arms, make a futile attempt to regain his balance, and disappear over the
      edge of the roof. One instant he was standing there, splendid, superb; the
      next, the corner of the parapet was empty, all that stood there was a
      broken, splintered post and a tangle of wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not have moved at first; at least, it seemed hours before the full
      significance of the thing penetrated my dazed brain. When I got up I
      seemed to walk, to crawl, with leaden weights holding back my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got to the corner I had to catch the post for support. I knew
      somebody was saying, &ldquo;Oh, how terrible!&rdquo; over and over. It was only
      afterward that I knew it had been myself. And then some other voice was
      saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. Please don&rsquo;t be frightened. I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dared to look over the parapet, finally, and instead of a crushed and
      unspeakable body, there was Mr. Harbison, sitting about eight feet below
      me, with his feet swinging into space and a long red scratch from the
      corner of his eye across his cheek. There was a sort of mansard there,
      with windows, and just enough coping to keep him from rolling off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had fallen&mdash;all the way,&rdquo; I gasped, trying to keep my
      lips from trembling. &ldquo;I&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t dangle your feet like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem at all glad of his escape. He sat there gloomily, peering
      into the gulf beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t so&mdash;er&mdash;messy and generally unpleasant,&rdquo; he
      replied without looking up, &ldquo;I would slide off and go the rest of the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are childish,&rdquo; I said severely. &ldquo;See if you can get through the
      window behind you. If you can not, I&rsquo;ll come down and unfasten it.&rdquo; But
      the window was open, and I had a chance to sit down and gather up the
      scattered ends of my nerves. To my surprise, however, when he came back he
      made no effort to renew our conversation. He ignored me completely, and
      went to work at once to repair the damage to his wires, with his back to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are very rude,&rdquo; I said at last. &ldquo;You fell over there and I
      thought you were killed. The nervous shock I experienced is just as bad as
      if you had gone&mdash;all the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down the hammer and came over to me without speaking. Then, when he
      was quite close, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry if I startled you. I did not flatter myself that you
      would be profoundly affected, in any event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to that,&rdquo; I said lightly, &ldquo;it makes me ill for days if my car runs
      over a dog.&rdquo; He looked at me in silence. &ldquo;You are not going to get up on
      that parapet again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilson,&rdquo; he said, without paying the slightest attention to my
      question, &ldquo;will you tell me what I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or have not done? I have racked my brains&mdash;stayed awake all of last
      night. At first I hoped it was impersonal, that, womanlike you were merely
      venting general disfavor on one particular individual. But&mdash;your
      hostility is to me, personally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised my eyebrows, coldly interrogative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he went on calmly&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps I was a fool here on the roof&mdash;the
      night before last. If I said anything that I should not, I ask your
      pardon. If it is not that, I think you ought to ask mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was angry enough then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be only one opinion about your conduct,&rdquo; I retorted warmly. &ldquo;It
      was worse than brutal. It&mdash;it was unspeakable. I have no words for it&mdash;except
      that I loathe it&mdash;and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very grim by this time. &ldquo;I have heard you say something like that
      before&mdash;only I was not the unfortunate in that case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I was choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under different circumstances I should be the last person to recall
      anything so&mdash;personal. But the circumstances are unusual.&rdquo; He took an
      angry step toward me. &ldquo;Will you tell me what I have done? Or shall I go
      down and ask the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;or I will tell them what you did! How you
      waylaid me on those stairs there, and forced your caresses, your kisses,
      on me! Oh, I could die with shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence that followed was as unexpected as it was ominous. I knew he
      was staring at me, and I was furious to find myself so emotional, so much
      more the excited of the two. Finally, I looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can not deny it,&rdquo; I said, a sort of anti-climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He was very quiet, very grim, quite composed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated
      judicially. &ldquo;I do not deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not? Or he would not? Which?

      Chapter XIV. ALMOST, BUT NOT QUITE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dal had been acting strangely all day. Once, early in the evening, when I
      had doubled no trump, he led me a club without apology, and later on,
      during his dummy, I saw him writing our names on the back of an envelope,
      and putting numbers after them. At my earliest opportunity I went to Max.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something the matter with Dal, Max,&rdquo; I volunteered. &ldquo;He has been
      acting strangely all day, and just now he was making out a list&mdash;names
      and numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to blame for that, Kit,&rdquo; Max said seriously. &ldquo;You put washing soda
      instead of baking soda in those biscuits today, and he thinks he is a
      steam laundry. Those are laundry lists he&rsquo;s making out. He asked me a
      little while ago if I wanted a domestic finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I had put washing soda in the biscuits. The book said soda, and how
      is one to know which is meant?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you are calculated for a domestic finish,&rdquo; I said coldly
      as I turned away. &ldquo;In any case I disclaim any such responsibility. But&mdash;there
      is SOMETHING on Dal&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max came after me. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Kit. You haven&rsquo;t said a nice word to
      me today, and you go around bristling with your chin up and two red spots
      on your cheeks&mdash;like whatever-her-name-was with the snakes instead of
      hair. I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m so crazy about you; I always meant to love a
      girl with a nice disposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him then. Dal had gone into the reception room and closed the
      doors. And because he had been acting so strangely, and partly to escape
      from Max, whose eyes looked threatening, I followed him. Just as I opened
      the door quietly and looked in, Dallas switched off the lights, and I
      could hear him groping his way across the room. Then somebody&mdash;not
      Dal&mdash;spoke from the corner, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Brown, sir?&rdquo; It was Flannigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is everything here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All but the powder, sir. Don&rsquo;t step too close. They&rsquo;re spread all over
      the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you taken the curtains down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light one, will you, Flannigan? I want to see the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flare showed Dallas and Flannigan bent over the timepiece. And it
      showed something else. The rug had been turned back from the windows which
      opened on the street, and the curtains had been removed. On the bare
      hardwood floor just beneath the windows was an array of pans of various
      sizes, dish pans, cake tins, and a metal foot tub. The pans were raised
      from the floor on bricks, and seemed to be full of paper. All the chairs
      and tables were pushed back against the wall, and the bric-a-brac was
      stacked on the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour yet,&rdquo; Dal said, closing his watch. &ldquo;Plenty of time, and
      remember the signal, four short and two long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four short and two long&mdash;all right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;Flannigan, here&rsquo;s something for you, on account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dal turned to go out, tripped over the rug, said something, and passed me
      without an idea of my presence. A moment later Flannigan went out, and I
      was left, huddled against the wall, and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was puzzling enough. &ldquo;Four long and two short!&rdquo; &ldquo;All but the powder!&rdquo;
       Not that I believed for a moment what Max had said, and anyhow Flannigan
      was the sanest person I ever saw in my life. But it all seemed a part of
      the mystery that had been hanging over us for several days. I felt my way
      across the room and knelt by the pans. Yes, they were there, full of paper
      and mounted on bricks. It had not been a delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I straightened on my knees suddenly, for an automobile passing
      under the windows had sounded four short honks and two long ones. The
      signal was followed instantly by a crash. The foot bath had fallen from
      its supports, and lay, quivering and vibrating with horrid noises at my
      feet. The next moment Mr. Harbison had thrown open the door and leaped
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he demanded. Against the light I could see him reaching for
      his hip pocket, and the rest crowding up around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me,&rdquo; I quavered, &ldquo;that is, I. The&mdash;the dish pan upset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dish pan!&rdquo; Bella said from back in the crowd. &ldquo;Kit, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim forced his way through then and turned on the lights. I have no doubt
      I looked very strange, kneeling there on the bare floor, with a row of
      pans mounted on bricks behind me, and the furniture all piled on itself in
      a back corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kit! What in the world&mdash;!&rdquo; Jim began, and stopped. He stared from me
      to the pans, to the windows, to the bric-a-brac on the mantel, and back to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat stonily silent. Why should I explain? Whenever I got into a foolish
      position, and tried to explain, and tell how it happened, and who was
      really to blame, they always brought it back to ME somehow. So I sat there
      on the floor and let them stare. And finally Lollie Mercer got her breath
      and said, &ldquo;How perfectly lovely; it&rsquo;s a charade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Anne guessed &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo; at once. &ldquo;Kit, you know, and the pans and&mdash;all
      that,&rdquo; she said vaguely. At that they all took to guessing! And I sat
      still, until Mr. Harbison saw the storm in my eyes and came over to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you hurt your ankle?&rdquo; he said in an undertone. &ldquo;Let me help you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not hurt,&rdquo; I said coldly, &ldquo;and even if I were, it would be
      unnecessary to trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not help being troubled,&rdquo; he returned, just as evenly. &ldquo;&lsquo;You see,
      it makes me ill for days if my car runs over a dog.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, at that moment Dal came in. He pushed his way through the crowd
      without a word, shut off the lights, crashed through the pans and slammed
      the shutters closed. Then he turned and addressed the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the lunatics&mdash;!&rdquo; he began, only there was more to it than
      that. &ldquo;A fellow goes to all kinds of trouble to put an end to this
      miserable situation, and the entire household turns out and sets to work
      to frustrate the whole scheme. You LIKE to stay here, don&rsquo;t you, like
      chickens in a coop? Where&rsquo;s Flannigan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody understood Dal&rsquo;s wrath then, but it seems he meant to arrange the
      plot himself, and when it was ripe, and the hour nearly come, he intended
      to wager that he could break the quarantine, and to take any odds he could
      get that he would free the entire party in half an hour. As for the plan
      itself, it was idiotically simple; we were perfectly delighted when we
      heard it. It was so simple and yet so comprehensive. We didn&rsquo;t see how it
      COULD fail. Both the Mercer girls kissed Dal on the strength of it, and
      Anne was furious. Jim was not so much pleased, for some reason or other,
      and Mr. Harbison looked thoughtful rather than merry. Aunt Selina had gone
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea, of course, was to start an embryo fire just inside the windows,
      in the pans, to feed it with the orange-fire powder that is used on the
      Fourth of July, and when we had thrown open the windows and yelled &ldquo;fire&rdquo;
       and all the guards and reporters had rushed to the front of the house, to
      escape quietly by a rear door from the basement kitchen, get into machines
      Dal had in waiting, and lose ourselves as quickly as we could.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see how simple it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were terribly excited, of course. Every one rushed madly for motor
      coats and veils, and Dal shuffled the numbers so the people going the same
      direction would have the same machine. We called to each other as we
      dressed about Mamaroneck or Lakewood or wherever we happened to have
      relatives. Everybody knew everybody else, and his friends. The Mercer
      girls were going to cruise until the trouble blew over, the Browns were
      going to Pinehurst, and Jim was going to Africa to hunt, if he could get
      out of the harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the Harbison man seemed to have no plans; quite suddenly with the
      world so near again, the world of country houses and steam yachts and all
      the rest of it, he ceased to be one of us. It was not his world at all. He
      stood back and watched the kaleidoscope of our coats and veils,
      half-quizzically, but with something in his face that I had not seen there
      before. If he had not been so self-reliant and big, I would have said he
      was lonely. Not that he was pathetic in any sense of the word. Of course,
      he avoided me, which was natural and exactly what I wished. Bella never
      was far from him and at the last she loaded him with her jewel case and a
      muff and traveling bag and asked him to her cousins&rsquo; on Long Island. I
      felt sure he was going to decline, when he glanced across at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go,&rdquo; I said, very politely. &ldquo;They are charming people.&rdquo; And he
      accepted at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a transparent plot on Bella&rsquo;s part: Two elderly maiden ladies,
      house miles from anywhere, long evenings in the music room with an open
      fire and Bella at the harp playing the two songs she knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were ready and gathered in the kitchen, in the darkness, of
      course, Dal went up on the roof and signaled with a lantern to the cars on
      the drive. Then he went downstairs, took a last look at the drawing room,
      fired the papers, shook on the powder, opened the windows and yelled
      &ldquo;fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, huddled in the kitchen we had heard little or nothing. But we
      plainly heard Dal on the first floor and Flannigan on the second yelling
      &ldquo;fire,&rdquo; and the patter of feet as the guards ran to the front of the
      house. And at that instant we remembered Aunt Selina!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the cause of the whole trouble. I don&rsquo;t know why they turned on
      me; she wasn&rsquo;t my aunt. But by the time we had got her out of bed, and had
      wrapped her in an eiderdown comfort, and stuck slippers on her feet and a
      motor veil on her head, the glare at the front of the house was beginning
      to die away. She didn&rsquo;t understand at all and we had no time to explain. I
      remember that she wanted to go back and get her &ldquo;plate,&rdquo; whatever that may
      be, but Jim took her by the arm and hurried her along, and the rest, who
      had waited, and were in awful tempers, stood aside and let them out first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door to the area steps was open, and by the street lights we could see
      a fence and a gate, which opened on a side street. Jim and Aunt Selina ran
      straight for the gate; the wind blowing Aunt Selina&rsquo;s comfort like a sail.
      Then, with our feet, so to speak, on the first rungs of the ladder of
      Liberty, it slipped. A half-dozen guards and reporters came around the
      house and drove us back like sheep into a slaughter pen. It was the most
      humiliating moment of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dal had been for fighting a way through, and just for a minute I think I
      went Berserk myself. But Max spied one of the reporters setting up a flash
      light as we stood, undecided, at the top of the steps, and after that
      there was nothing to do but retreat. We backed down slowly, to show them
      we were not afraid. And when we were all in the kitchen again, and had
      turned on the lights and Bella was crying with her head against Mr.
      Harbison&rsquo;s arm, Dal said cheerfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it has done some good, anyhow. We have lost Aunt Selina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And we all shook hands on it, although we were sorry about Jim. And Dal
      said we would have some champagne and drink to Aunt Selina&rsquo;s comfort, and
      we could have her teeth fumigated and send them to her. Somebody said
      &ldquo;Poor old Jim,&rdquo; and at that Bella looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared around the group, and then she went quite pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;that Jim is&mdash;out there too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim and Aunt Selina!&rdquo; I said as calmly as I could for joy. You can see
      how it simplified the situation for me. &ldquo;By this time they are a mile
      away, and going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody shook hands again except Bella. She had dropped into a chair,
      and sat biting her lip and breathing hard, and she would not join in any
      of the hilarity at getting rid of Aunt Selina. Finally she got up and
      knocked over her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a lot of cowards,&rdquo; she stormed. &ldquo;You deserted them out there,
      left them. Heaven knows where they are&mdash;a defenseless old woman, and&mdash;and
      a man who did not even have an overcoat. And it is snowing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Dal said reassuringly. &ldquo;He can borrow Aunt Selina&rsquo;s comfort.
      Make the old lady discard from weakness. Anyhow, Bella, if I know anything
      of human nature, the old lady will make it hot enough for him. Poor old
      Jim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they shook hands again, and with that there came a terrible banging
      at the door, which we had locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; some one commanded. It was one of the guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open it yourself!&rdquo; Dallas called, moving a kitchen table to reenforce the
      lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open that door or we will break it in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dallas put his hands in his pockets, seated himself on the table, and
      whistled cheerfully. We could hear them conferring outside, and they made
      another appeal which was refused. Suddenly Bella came over and confronted
      Dallas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have brought them back!&rdquo; she said dramatically. &ldquo;They are out there
      now; I distinctly heard Jim&rsquo;s voice. Open that door, Dallas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, DON&rsquo;T let them in!&rdquo; I wailed. It was quite involuntary, but the
      disappointment was too awful. &ldquo;Dallas, DON&rsquo;T open that door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dal swung his feet and smiled from Bella to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what a solution it is to all our difficulties,&rdquo; he said easily.
      &ldquo;Without Aunt Selina I could be happy here indefinitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was more knocking, and somebody&mdash;Max, I think&mdash;said to let
      them in, that it was a fool thing anyhow, and that he wanted to go to bed
      and forget it; his feet were cold. And just then there was a crash, and
      part of one of the windows fell in. The next blow from outside brought the
      rest of the glass, and&mdash;somebody was coming through, feet first. It
      was Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak to any of us, but turned and helped in a bundle of red
      and yellow silk comfort that proved to be Aunt Selina, also feet first. I
      had a glimpse of a half-dozen heads outside, guards and reporters. Then
      Jim jerked the shade down and unswathed Aunt Selina&rsquo;s legs so that she
      could walk, offered his arm, and stalked past us and upstairs, without a
      word!
    </p>
    <p>
      None of us spoke. We turned out the lights and went upstairs and took off
      our wraps and went to bed. It had been almost a fiasco.

    <h2>
      Chapter XV. SUSPICION AND DISCORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every one was nasty the next morning. Aunt Selina declared that her feet
      were frost-bitten and kept Bella rubbing them with ice water all morning.
      And Jim was impossible. He refused to speak to any of us and he watched
      Bella furtively, as if he suspected her of trying to get him out of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When luncheon time came around and he had shown no indication of going to
      the telephone and ordering it, we had a conclave, and Max was chosen to
      remind him of the hour. Jim was shut in the studio, and we waited together
      in the hall while Max went up. When he came down he was somewhat ruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t open the door,&rdquo; he reported, &ldquo;and when I told him it was meal
      time, he said he wasn&rsquo;t hungry, and he didn&rsquo;t give a whoop about the rest
      of us. He had asked us here to dinner; he hadn&rsquo;t proposed to adopt us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we finally ordered luncheon ourselves, and about two o&rsquo;clock Jim came
      downstairs sheepishly, and ate what was left. Anne declared that Bella had
      been scolding him in the upper hall, but I doubted it. She was never seen
      to speak to him unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement of the escape over, Mr. Harbison and I remained on terms of
      armed neutrality. And Max still hunted for Anne&rsquo;s pearls, using them, the
      men declared, as a good excuse to avoid tinkering with the furnace or
      repairing the dumb waiter, which took the queerest notions, and stopped
      once, half-way up from the kitchen, for an hour, with the dinner on it.
      Anyhow, Max was searching the house systematically, armed with a copy of
      Poe&rsquo;s Purloined Letter and Gaboriau&rsquo;s Monsieur LeCoq. He went through the
      seats of the chairs with hatpins, tore up the beds, and lifted rugs, until
      the house was in a state of confusion. And the next day, the fourth, he
      found something&mdash;not much, but it was curious. He had been in the
      studio, poking around behind the dusty pictures, with Jimmy expostulating
      every time he moved anything and the rest standing around watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max was strutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We get it by elimination,&rdquo; he said importantly. &ldquo;The pearls being nowhere
      else in the house, they must be here in the studio. Three parts of the
      studio having yielded nothing, they must be in the fourth. Ladies and
      gentlemen, let me have your attention for one moment. I tap this canvas
      with my wand&mdash;there is nothing up my sleeve. Then I prepare to move
      the canvas&mdash;so. And I put my hand in the pocket of this disreputable
      velvet coat, so. Behold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave a low exclamation and looked at something he held in his
      hand. Every one stepped forward, and on his palm was the small diamond
      clasp from Anne&rsquo;s collar!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy was apoplectic. He tried to smile, but no one else did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be flabbergasted!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I say, you people, you don&rsquo;t
      think for a minute that I put that thing there? Why, I haven&rsquo;t worn that
      coat for a month. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a trick of yours, Max.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Max shook his head; he looked stupefied, and stood gazing from the
      clasp to the pocket of the old painting coat. Betty dropped on a folding
      stool, that promptly collapsed with her and created a welcome diversion,
      while Anne pounced on the clasp greedily, with a little cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will find it all now,&rdquo; she said excitedly. &ldquo;Did you look in the other
      pockets, Max?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, I was conscious of an air of constraint among
      the men. Dallas was whistling softly, and Mr. Harbison, having rescued
      Betty, was standing silent and aloof, watching the scene with
      non-committal eyes. It was Max who spoke first, after a hurried inventory
      of the other pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else,&rdquo; he said constrainedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll move the rest of the
      canvases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jim interfered, to every one&rsquo;s surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, if I were you, Max. There&rsquo;s nothing back there. I had &lsquo;em out
      yesterday.&rdquo; He was quite pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Max said gruffly. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a practical joke, Jim, why don&rsquo;t
      you fess up? Anne has worried enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pearls are not there, I tell you,&rdquo; Jim began. Although the studio was
      cold, there were little fine beads of moisture on his face. &ldquo;I must ask
      you not to move those pictures.&rdquo; And then Aunt Selina came to the rescue;
      she stalked over and stood with her back against the stack of canvases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can understand this,&rdquo; she declaimed, &ldquo;you gentlemen are
      trying to intimate that James knows something of that young woman&rsquo;s
      jewelry, because you found part of it in his pocket. Certainly you will
      not move the pictures. How do you know that the young gentleman who said
      he found it there didn&rsquo;t have it up his sleeve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked around triumphantly, and Max glowered. Dallas soothed her,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How do we know that Max didn&rsquo;t have the clasp up
      his sleeve? My dear lady, neither my wife nor I care anything for the
      pearls, as compared with the priceless pearl of peace. I suggest tea on
      the roof; those in favor&mdash;? My arm, Miss Caruthers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all well enough for Jim to say later that he didn&rsquo;t dare to have
      the canvases moved, for he had stuck behind them all sorts of chorus girl
      photographs and life-class crayons that were not for Aunt Selina&rsquo;s eye,
      besides four empty siphons, two full ones, and three bottles of whisky.
      Not a soul believed him; there was a a new element of suspicion and
      discord in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one went up on the roof and left him to his mystery. Anne drank her
      tea in a preoccupied silence, with half-closed eyes, an attitude that
      boded ill to somebody. The rest were feverishly gay, and Aunt Selina, with
      a pair of arctics on her feet and a hot-water bottle at her back, sat in
      the middle of the tent and told me familiar anecdotes of Jimmy&rsquo;s early
      youth (had he known, he would have slain her). Betty and Mr. Harbison had
      found a medicine ball, and were running around like a pair of children. It
      was quite certain that neither his escape from death nor my accusation
      weighed heavily on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Aunt Selina was busy with the time Jim had swallowed an open safety
      pin, and just as the pin had been coughed up, or taken out of his nose&mdash;I
      forget which&mdash;Jim himself appeared and sulkily demanded the privacy
      of the roof for his training hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he was training. Flannigan claimed to know the system that had
      reduced the president to what he is, and he and Jim had a seance every day
      which left Jim feeling himself for bruises all evening. He claimed to be
      losing flesh; he said he could actually feel it going, and he and
      Flannigan had spent an entire afternoon in the cellar three days before
      with a potato barrel, a cane-seated chair and a lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole thing had been shrouded in mystery. They sandpapered the inside
      of the barrel and took out all the nails, and when they had finished they
      carried it to the roof and put it in a corner behind the tent. Everybody
      was curious, but Flannigan refused any information about it, and merely
      said it was part of his system. Dal said that if HE had anything like that
      in his system he certainly would be glad to get rid of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter to six Jim appeared, still sullen from the events of the
      afternoon and wearing a dressing gown and a pair of slippers, Flannigan
      following him with a sponge, a bucket of water and an armful of bath
      towels. Everybody protested at having to move, but he was firm, and they
      all filed down the stairs. I was the last, with Aunt Selina just ahead of
      me. At the top of the stairs, she turned around suddenly to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That policeman looks cruel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, he&rsquo;s been in a bad
      humor all day. More than likely he&rsquo;ll put James flat on the roof and tramp
      on him, under pretense of training him. All policemen are inhuman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only rolls him over a barrel or something like that,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James had a bump like an egg over his ear last night,&rdquo; Aunt Selina
      insisted, glaring at Flannigan&rsquo;s unconscious back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
      safe to leave him. It is my time to relax for thirty minutes, or I would
      watch him. You will have to stay,&rdquo; she said, fixing me with her imperious
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I stayed. Jim didn&rsquo;t want me, and Flannigan muttered mutiny. But it was
      easier to obey Aunt Selina than to clash with her, and anyhow I wanted to
      see the barrel in use.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never saw any one train before. It is not a joyful spectacle. First,
      Flannigan made Jim run, around and around the roof. He said it stirred up
      his food and brought it in contact with his liver, to be digested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flannigan, from meekness and submission, of a sort, in the kitchen, became
      an autocrat on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more,&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;Pick up your feet, sir! Pick up your feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jim would stagger doggedly past me, where I sat on the parapet, his
      poor cheeks shaking and the tail of his bath robe wrapping itself around
      his legs. Yes, he ran in the bath robe in deference to me. It seems there
      isn&rsquo;t much to a running suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head up,&rdquo; Flannigan would say. &ldquo;Lift your knees, sir. Didn&rsquo;t you ever see
      a horse with string halt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let him stop finally, and gave him a moment to get his breath. Then he
      set him to turning somersaults. They spread the cushions from the couch in
      the tent on the roof, and Jim would poke his head down and say a prayer,
      and then curve over as gracefully as a sausage and come up gasping, as if
      he had been pushed off a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five pounds a day; not less, sir,&rdquo; Flannigan said encouragingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      drop it in chunks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim looked at the tin as if he expected to see the chunks lying at his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, wiping the back of his neck. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re in here thirty days
      that will be one hundred and fifty pounds. Don&rsquo;t forget to stop in time,
      Flannigan. I don&rsquo;t want to melt away like a candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was cheered, however, by the promise of reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that, Kit?&rdquo; he called to me. &ldquo;Your uncle is going to
      look as angular as a problem in geometry. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be the original
      reductio ad absurdum. Do you want me to stand on my head, Flannigan?
      Wouldn&rsquo;t that reduce something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brains, sir,&rdquo; Flannigan retorted gravely, and presented a pair of
      boxing gloves. Jim visibly quailed, but he put them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Flannigan,&rdquo; he remarked, as he fastened them, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking
      of wearing these all the time. They hide my character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flannigan looked puzzled, but he did not ask an explanation. He demanded
      that Jim shed the bath robe, which he finally did, on my promise to watch
      the sunset. Then for fully a minute there was no sound save of feet
      running rapidly around the roof, and an occasional soft thud. Each thud
      was accompanied by a grunt or two from Jim. Flannigan was grimly silent.
      Once there was a smart rap, an oath from the policeman, and a mirthless
      chuckle from Jim. The chuckle ended in a crash, however, and I turned. Jim
      was lying on his back on the roof, and Flannigan was wiping his ear with a
      towel. Jim sat up and ran his hand down his ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all here,&rdquo; he observed after a minute. &ldquo;I thought I missed one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only way to take a man&rsquo;s weight down,&rdquo; Flannigan said dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim got up dizzily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down on the roof, I suppose you mean,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next proceedings were mysterious. Flannigan rolled the barrel into the
      tent, and carried in a small glass lamp. With the material at hand he
      seemed to be effecting a combination, no new one, to judge by his
      facility. Then he called Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the tent Jim turned to me, his bathrobe toga fashion around
      his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very essential part of the treatment,&rdquo; he said solemnly. &ldquo;The
      exercise, according to Flannigan, loosens up the adipose tissue. The next
      step is to boil it out. I hope, unless your instructions compel you, that
      you will at least have the decency to stay out of the tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going at once,&rdquo; I said, outraged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here because I&rsquo;m mad
      about it, and you know it. And don&rsquo;t pose with that bath robe. If you
      think you&rsquo;re a character out of Roman history, look at your legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you,&rdquo; he said sulkily. &ldquo;Only I&rsquo;m tired of having
      you choked down my throat every time I open my mouth, Kit. And don&rsquo;t go
      just yet. Flannigan is going for my clothes as soon as he lights the&mdash;the
      lamp, and&mdash;somebody ought to watch the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all there was to it. I said I would guard the steps, and
      Flannigan, having ignited the combination, whatever it was, went
      downstairs. How was I to know that Bella would come up when she did? Was
      it my fault that the lamp got too high, and that Flannigan couldn&rsquo;t hear
      Jim calling? Or that just as Bella reached the top of the steps Jim should
      come to the door of the tent, wearing the barrel part of his hot-air
      cabinet, and yelling for a doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella came to a dead stop on the upper step, with her mouth open. She
      looked at Jim, at the inadequate barrel, and from them she looked at me.
      Then she began to laugh, one of her hysterical giggles, and she turned and
      went down again. As Jim and I stared at each other we could hear her
      gurgling down the hall below.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had violent hysterics for an hour, with Anne rubbing her forehead and
      Aunt Selina burning a feather out of the feather duster under her nose.
      Only Jim and I understood, and we did not tell. Luckily, the next thing
      that occurred drove Bella and her nerves from everybody&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock, when Bella had dropped asleep and everybody else was
      dressed for dinner, Aunt Selina discovered that the house was cold, and
      ordered Dal to the furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Dal&rsquo;s day at the furnace; Flannigan had been relieved of that part
      of the work after twice setting fire to a chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes Dal came back and spoke a few words to Max, who followed
      him to the basement, and in ten minutes more Flannigan puffed up the steps
      and called Mr. Harbison.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not curious, but I knew that something had happened. While Aunt
      Selina was talking suffrage to Anne&mdash;who said she had always been
      tremendously interested in the subject, and if women got the suffrage
      would they be allowed to vote?&mdash;I slipped back to the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table was laid for dinner, but Flannigan was not in sight. I could
      hear voices from somewhere, faint voices that talked rapidly, and after a
      while I located the sounds under my feet. The men were all in the
      basement, and something must have happened. I flew back to the basement
      stairs, to meet Mr. Harbison at the foot. He was grimy and dusty, with
      streaks of coal dust over his face, and he had been examining his
      revolver. I was just in time to see him slip it into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;Is any one hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been cleaning out the furnace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a revolver! How interesting&mdash;and unusual!&rdquo; I said dryly, and
      slipped past him as he barred the way. He was not pleased; I heard him
      mutter something and come rapidly after me, but I had the voices as a
      guide, and I was not going to be turned back like a child. The men had
      gathered around a low stone arch in the furnace room, and were looking
      down a short flight of steps, into a sort of vault, evidently under the
      pavement. A faint light came from a small grating above, and there was a
      close, musty smell in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it must have been last night,&rdquo; Dallas was saying. &ldquo;Wilson and
      I were here before we went to bed, and I&rsquo;ll swear that hole was not there
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not there this morning, sir,&rdquo; Flannigan insisted. &ldquo;It has been
      made during the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it could not have been done this afternoon,&rdquo; Mr. Harbison said
      quietly. &ldquo;I was fussing with the telephone wire down here. I would have
      heard the noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in his voice made me look at him, and certainly his expression
      was unusual. He was watching us all intently while Dallas pointed out to
      me the cause of the excitement. From the main floor of the furnace room, a
      flight of stone steps surmounted by an arch led into the coal cellar,
      beneath the street. The coal cellar was of brick, with a cement floor, and
      in the left wall there gaped an opening about three feet by three, leading
      into a cavernous void, perfectly black&mdash;evidently a similar vault
      belonging to the next house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole place was ghostly, full of shadows, shivery with possibilities.
      It was Mr. Harbison finally who took Jim&rsquo;s candle and crawled through the
      aperture. We waited in dead silence, listening to his feet crunching over
      the coal beyond, watching the faint yellow light that came through the
      ragged opening in the wall. Then he came back and called through to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Place is locked, over here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Heavy oak door at the head of the
      steps. Whoever made that opening has done a prodigious amount of labor for
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The weapon, a crowbar, lay on the ground beside the bricks, and he picked
      it up and balanced it on his hand. Dallas&rsquo; florid face was almost comical
      in his bewilderment; as for Jimmy&mdash;he slammed a piece of slag at the
      furnace and walked away. At the door he turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you accuse me of it?&rdquo; he asked bitterly. &ldquo;Maybe you could find
      a lump of coal in my pockets if you searched me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked up the stairs then and left us. Dallas and I went up together,
      but we did not talk. There seemed to be nothing to say. Not until I had
      closed and locked the door of my room did I venture to look at something
      that I carried in the palm of my hand. It was a watch, not running&mdash;a
      gentleman&rsquo;s flat gold watch, and it had been hanging by its fob to a nail
      in the bricks beside the aperture.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the back of the watch were the initials, T.H.H. and the picture of a
      girl, cut from a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my picture.

      Chapter XVI. I FACE FLANNIGAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dinner waited that night while everybody went to the coal cellar and
      stared at the hole in the wall, and watched while Max took a tracing of it
      and of some footprints in the coal dust on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not go. I went into the library with the guilty watch in the fold of
      my gown, and found Mr. Harbison there, staring through the February gloom
      at the blank wall of the next house, and quite unconscious of the reporter
      with a drawing pad just below him in the area-way. I went over and closed
      the shutters before his very eyes, but even then he did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be good enough to turn around?&rdquo; I demanded at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said wheeling. &ldquo;Are YOU here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There wasn&rsquo;t any reply to that, so I took the watch and placed it on the
      library table between us. The effect was all that I had hoped. He stared
      at it for an instant, then at me, and with his hand outstretched for it,
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; he asked. I couldn&rsquo;t understand his expression.
      He looked embarrassed, but not at all afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you know, Mr. Harbison,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I did. You opened it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood looking at each other across the table. It was his glance that
      wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the picture&mdash;of you,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You see, down there in
      South America, a fellow hasn&rsquo;t much to do in the evenings, and a&mdash;a
      chum of mine and I&mdash;we were awfully down on what we called the
      plutocrats, the&mdash;the leisure classes. And when that picture of yours
      came in the paper, we had&mdash;we had an argument. He said&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he said it was the picture of an empty-faced society girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I maintained there were possibilities in the face.&rdquo; He put both
      hands on the table, and, bending forward, looked down at me. &ldquo;Well, I was
      a fool, I admit. I said your eyes were kind and candid, in spite of that
      haughty mouth. You see, I said I was a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are exceedingly rude,&rdquo; I managed finally. &ldquo;If you want to
      know where I found your watch, it was down in the coal cellar. And if you
      admit you are an idiot, I am not. I&mdash;I know all about Bella&rsquo;s
      bracelet&mdash;and the board on the roof, and&mdash;oh, if you would only
      leave&mdash;Anne&rsquo;s necklace&mdash;on the coal, or somewhere&mdash;and get
      away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My voice got beyond me then, and I dropped into a chair and covered my
      face. I could feel him staring at the back of my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; something or other, he said finally, and then he
      turned on his heel and went out. By the time I got my eyes dry (yes, I was
      crying; I always do when I am angry) I heard Jim coming downstairs, and I
      tucked the watch out of sight. Would anyone have foreseen the trouble that
      watch would make!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim was sulky. He dropped into a chair and stretched out his legs, looking
      gloomily at nothing. Then he got up and ambled into his den, closing the
      door behind him without having spoken a word. It was more than human
      nature could stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went into the den he was stretched on the davenport with his face
      buried in the cushions. He looked absolutely wilted, and every line of him
      was drooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on out, Kit,&rdquo; he said, in a smothered voice. &ldquo;Be a good girl and don&rsquo;t
      follow me around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are shameless!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;Follow you! When you are hung around my
      neck like a&mdash;like a&mdash;&rdquo; Millstone was what I wanted to say, but I
      couldn&rsquo;t think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned over and looked up from his cushions like an ill-treated and
      suffering cherub.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done for, Kit,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Bella went up to the studio after we
      left, and investigated that corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she find? The necklace?&rdquo; I asked eagerly. He was too wretched to
      notice this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that picture of you that I did last winter. She is crazy&mdash;she
      says she is going upstairs and sit in Takahiro&rsquo;s room and take smallpox
      and die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; I said rudely, and somebody hammered on the door and
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me for disturbing you,&rdquo; Bella said, in her best
      dear-me-I&rsquo;m-glad-I-knocked manner. &ldquo;But&mdash;Flannigan says the dinner
      has not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; Jim exclaimed. &ldquo;I forgot to order the confounded dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was eight o&rsquo;clock by that time, and as it took an hour at least after
      telephoning the order, everybody looked blank when they heard. The entire
      family, except Mr. Harbison, who had not appeared again, escorted Jim to
      the telephone and hung around hungrily, suggesting new dishes every
      minute. And then&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t raise Central. It was fifteen minutes
      before we gave up, and stood staring at one another despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call out of a window, and get one of those infernal reporters to do
      something useful for once,&rdquo; Max suggested. But he was indignantly hushed.
      We would have starved first. Jim was peering into the transmitter and
      knocking the receiver against his hand, like a watch that had stopped. But
      nothing happened. Flannigan reported a box of breakfast food, two lemons,
      and a pineapple cheese, a combination that didn&rsquo;t seem to lend itself to
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went back to the dining room from sheer force of habit and sat around
      the table and looked at the lemonade Flannigan had made. Anne WOULD talk
      about the salad her last cook had concocted, and Max told about a little
      town in Connecticut where the restaurant keeper smokes a corn-cob pipe
      while he cooks the most luscious fried clams in America. And Aunt Selina
      related that in her family they had a recipe for chicken smothered in
      cream. And then we sipped the weak lemonade and nibbled at the cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To change this gridiron martyrdom,&rdquo; Dallas said finally, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s
      Harbison? Still looking for his watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; Everybody said it in a different tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Says his watch was taken last night from the
      studio. Better get him down to take a squint at the telephone. Likely he
      can fix it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flannigan was beside me with the cheese. And at that moment I felt Mr.
      Harbison&rsquo;s stolen watch slip out of my girdle, slide greasily across my
      lap, and clatter to the floor. Flannigan stooped, but luckily it had gone
      under the table. To have had it picked up, to have had to explain how I
      got it, to see them try to ignore my picture pasted in it&mdash;oh, it was
      impossible! I put my foot over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop something?&rdquo; Dallas asked perfunctorily, rising. Flannigan was still
      half kneeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fork,&rdquo; I said, as easily as I could, and the conversation went on. But
      Flannigan knew, and I knew he knew. He watched my every movement like a
      hawk after that, standing just behind my chair. I dropped my useless
      napkin, to have it whirled up before it reached the floor. I said to Betty
      that my shoe buckle was loose, and actually got the watch in my hand, only
      to let it slip at the critical moment. Then they all got up and went sadly
      back to the library, and Flannigan and I faced each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flannigan was not a handsome man at any time, though up to then he had at
      least looked amiable. But now as I stood with my hand on the back of my
      chair, his face grew suddenly menacing. The silence was absolute. I was
      the guiltiest wretch alive, and opposite me the law towered and glowered,
      and held the yellow remnant of a pineapple cheese! And in the silence that
      wretched watch lay and ticked and ticked and ticked. Then Flannigan
      creaked over and closed the door into the hall, came back, picked up the
      watch, and looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re unlucky, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the nerve all
      right, but you ain&rsquo;t cute enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; I quavered. &ldquo;Give me that watch to return to
      Mr. Harbison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; he retorted easily. &ldquo;I give it back myself, like I did
      the bracelet, and&mdash;like I&rsquo;m going to give back the necklace, if
      you&rsquo;ll act like a sensible little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only choke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s foolish, any way you look at it,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;Here you are, lots
      of friends, folks that think you&rsquo;re all right. Why, I reckon there isn&rsquo;t
      one of them that wouldn&rsquo;t lend you money if you needed it so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be still?&rdquo; I said furiously. &ldquo;Mr. Harbison left that watch&mdash;with
      me&mdash;an hour ago. Get him, and he will tell you so himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he would,&rdquo; Flannigan conceded, looking at me with grudging
      approval. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t be what I think he is, if he didn&rsquo;t lie up and down
      for you.&rdquo; There were voices in the hall. Flannigan came closer. &ldquo;An hour
      ago, you say. And he told me it was gone this morning! It&rsquo;s a losing game,
      miss. I&rsquo;ll give you twenty-four hours and then&mdash;the necklace, if you
      please, miss.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII. A CLASH AND A KISS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The clash that came that evening had been threatening for some time. Take
      an immovable body, represented by Mr. Harbison and his square jaw, and an
      irresistible force, Jimmy and his weight, and there is bound to be
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real fault was Jim&rsquo;s. He had gone entirely mad again over Bella, and
      thrown prudence to the winds. He mooned at her across the dinner table,
      and waylaid her on the stairs or in the back halls, just to hear her voice
      when she ordered him out of her way. He telephoned for flowers and candy
      for her quite shamelessly, and he got out a book of photographs that they
      had taken on their wedding journey, and kept it on the library table. The
      sole concession he made to our presumptive relationship was to bring me
      the responsibility for everything that went wrong, and his shirts for
      buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first I heard of the trouble was from Dal. He waylaid me in the hall
      after dinner that night, and his face was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t keep it up very long, Kit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With Jim
      trailing Bella all over the house, and the old lady keener every day, it&rsquo;s
      bound to come out somehow. And that isn&rsquo;t all. Jim and Harbison had a
      set-to today&mdash;about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me!&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Oh, I dare say I have been falling short again.
      What was Jim doing? Abusing me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dal looked cautiously over his shoulder, but no one was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that the gentle Bella has been unusually beastly today to Jim,
      and&mdash;I believe she&rsquo;s jealous of you, Kit. Jim followed her up to the
      roof before dinner with a box of flowers, and she tossed them over the
      parapet. She said, I believe, that she didn&rsquo;t want his flowers; he could
      buy them for you, and be damned to him, or some lady-like equivalent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim is a jellyfish,&rdquo; I said contemptuously. &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he only cared for one woman, and that was Bella; that he never
      had really cared for you and never would, and that divorce courts were not
      unmitigated evils if they showed people the way to real happiness. Which
      wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything if Harbison had not been in the tent, trying
      to sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dal did not know all the particulars, but it seems that relations between
      Jim and Mr. Harbison were rather strained. Bella had left the roof and Jim
      and the Harbison man came face to face in the door of the tent. According
      to Dal, little had been said, but Jim, bound by his promise to me, could
      not explain, and could only stammer something about being an old friend of
      Miss Knowles. And Tom had replied shortly that it was none of his
      business, but that there were some things friendship hardly justified, and
      tried to pass Jim. Jim was instantly enraged; he blocked the door to the
      roof and demanded to know what the other man meant. There were two or
      three versions of the answer he got. The general purport was that Mr.
      Harbison had no desire to explain further, and that the situation was
      forced on him. But if he insisted&mdash;when a man systematically ignored
      and neglected his wife for some one else, there were communities where he
      would be tarred and feathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning me?&rdquo; Jim demanded, apoplectic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The remark was a general one,&rdquo; Mr. Harbison retorted, &ldquo;but if you wish to
      make a concrete application&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dal had gone up just then, and found them glaring at each other, Jim with
      his hands clenched at his sides, and Mr. Harbison with his arms folded and
      very erect. Dal took Jim by the elbow and led him downstairs, muttering,
      and the situation was saved for the time. But Dal was not optimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do a bit yourself, Kit,&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;Look more cheerful, flirt
      a little. You can do that without trying. Take Max on for a day or so; it
      would be charity anyhow. But don&rsquo;t let Tom Harbison take into his head
      that you are grieving over Jim&rsquo;s neglect, or he&rsquo;s likely to toss him off
      the roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no reason to think that Mr. Harbison cares one way or the other
      about me,&rdquo; I said primly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s in love with
      me, do you, Dal?&rdquo; I watched him out of the corner of my eye, but he only
      looked amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love with you!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why bless your wicked little heart, no!
      He thinks you&rsquo;re a married woman! It&rsquo;s the principle of the thing he&rsquo;s
      fighting for. If I had as much principle as he has, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d put it
      out at interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max interrupted us just then, and asked if we knew where Mr. Harbison was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t find him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the telephone together and have
      enough left over to make another. Where do you suppose Harbison hides the
      tools? I&rsquo;m working with a corkscrew and two palette knives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard nothing more of the trouble that night. Max went to Jim about it,
      and Jim said angrily that only a fool would interfere between a man and
      his wife&mdash;wives. Whereupon Max retorted that a fool and his wives
      were soon parted, and left him. The two principals were coldly civil to
      each other, and smaller issues were lost as the famine grew more and more
      insistent. For famine it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      They worked the rest of the evening, but the telephone refused to revive
      and every one was starving. Individually our pride was at low ebb, but
      collectively it was still formidable. So we sat around and Jim played
      Grieg with the soft stops on, and Aunt Selina went to bed. The weather had
      changed, and it was sleeting, but anything was better than the drawing
      room. I was in a mood to battle with the elements or to cry&mdash;or both&mdash;so
      I slipped out, while Dal was reciting &ldquo;Give me three grains of corn,
      mother,&rdquo; threw somebody&rsquo;s overcoat over my shoulders, put on a man&rsquo;s soft
      hat&mdash;Jim&rsquo;s I think&mdash;and went up to the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark in the third floor hall, and I had to feel my way to the foot
      of the stairs. I went up quietly, and turned the knob of the door to the
      roof. At first it would not open, and I could hear the wind howling
      outside. Finally, however, I got the door open a little and wormed my way
      through. It was not entirely dark out there, in spite of the storm. A
      faint reflection of the street lights made it possible to distinguish the
      outlines of the boxwood plants, swaying in the wind, and the chimneys and
      the tent. And then&mdash;a dark figure disentangled itself from the
      nearest chimney and seemed to hurl itself at me. I remember putting out my
      hands and trying to say something, but the figure caught me roughly by the
      shoulders and knocked me back against the door frame. From miles away a
      heavy voice was saying, &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo; and then the roof gave from
      under me, and I was floating out on the storm, and sleet was beating in my
      face, and the wind was whispering over and over, &ldquo;Open your eyes, for
      God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did open them after a while, and finally I made out that I was laying on
      the floor in the tent. The lights were on, and I had a cold and damp
      feeling, and something wet was trickling down my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      I seemed to be alone, but in a second somebody came into the tent, and I
      saw it was Mr. Harbison, and that he had a double handful of half-melted
      snow. He looked frantic and determined, and only my sitting up quickly
      prevented my getting another snow bath. My neck felt queer and stiff, and
      I was very dizzy. When he saw that I was conscious he dropped the snow and
      stood looking down at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;that I very nearly choked you to death a
      little while ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me to be told so,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do I know too much, or
      what is it, Mr. Harbison?&rdquo; I felt terribly ill, but I would not let him
      see it. &ldquo;It is queer, isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;how we always select the roof for our
      little&mdash;differences?&rdquo; He seemed to relax somewhat at my gibe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was you,&rdquo; he explained shortly. &ldquo;I was waiting for&mdash;some
      one, and in the hat you wore and the coat, I mistook you. That&rsquo;s all. Can
      you stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I retorted. I could, but his summary manner displeased me. The
      sequel, however, was rather amazing, for he stooped suddenly and picked me
      up, and the next instant we were out in the storm together. At the door he
      stooped and felt for the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn it,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reach it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; I said shrewishly. &ldquo;Let me down; I can walk
      perfectly well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. Then he slid me slowly to my feet, but he did not open the
      door at once. &ldquo;Are you afraid to let me carry you down those stairs, after&mdash;Tuesday
      night?&rdquo; he asked, very low. &ldquo;You still think I did that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never been less sure of it than at that moment, but an imp of
      perversity made me retort, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hardly seemed to hear me. He stood looking down at me as I leaned
      against the door frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;To think that I might have killed you!&rdquo; And then&mdash;he
      stooped and suddenly kissed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the door was open, and he was leading me down into the
      house. At the foot of the staircase he paused, still holding my hand, and
      faced me in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry,&rdquo; he said steadily. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to be, but I&rsquo;m not.
      Only&mdash;I want you to know that I was not guilty&mdash;before. I didn&rsquo;t
      intend to now. I am&mdash;almost as much surprised as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was quite unable to speak, but I wrenched my hand loose. He stepped back
      to let me pass, and I went down the hall alone.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVIII. IT&rsquo;S ALL MY FAULT
    </h2>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t go to the drawing room again. I went into my own room and sat in
      the dark, and tried to be furiously angry, and only succeeded in feeling
      queer and tingly. One thing was absolutely certain: not the same man, but
      two different men had kissed me on the stairs to the roof. It sounds
      rather horrid and discriminating, but there was all the difference in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then&mdash;who had? And for whom had Mr. Harbison been waiting on the
      roof? &ldquo;Did you know that I nearly choked you to death a few minutes ago?&rdquo;
       Then he rather expected to finish somebody in that way! Who? Jim,
      probably. It was strange, too, but suddenly I realized that no matter how
      many suspicious things I mustered up against him&mdash;and there were
      plenty&mdash;down in my heart I didn&rsquo;t believe him guilty of anything,
      except this last and unforgivable offense. Whoever was trying to leave the
      house had taken the necklace, that seemed clear, unless Max was still
      foolishly trying to break quarantine and create one of the sensations he
      so dearly loves. This was a new idea, and some things upheld it, but Max
      had been playing bridge when I was kissed on the stairs, and there was
      still left that ridiculous incident of the comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella came up after I had gone to bed, and turned on the light to brush
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t leave this mausoleum soon, I&rsquo;ll be carried out,&rdquo; she declared.
      &ldquo;You in bed, Lollie Mercer and Dal flirting, Anne hysterical, and Jim
      making his will in the den! You will have to take Aunt Selina tonight,
      Kit; I&rsquo;m all in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll put her to bed, I&rsquo;ll keep her there,&rdquo; I conceded, after some
      parley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear.&rdquo; Bella came back from the door. &ldquo;Look here, Kit, you know
      Jim pretty well. Don&rsquo;t you think he looks ill? Thinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wreck,&rdquo; I said soberly. &ldquo;You have a lot to answer for, Bella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella went over to the cheval glass and looked in it. &ldquo;I avoid him all I
      can,&rdquo; she said, posing. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully funny; he&rsquo;s so afraid I&rsquo;ll think
      he&rsquo;s serious about you. He can&rsquo;t realize that for me he simply doesn&rsquo;t
      exist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, I took Aunt Selina, and about two o&rsquo;clock, while I was in my first
      sleep, I woke to find her standing beside me, tugging at my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody in the house,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Thieves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re in they&rsquo;ll not get out tonight,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I saw a man skulking on the stairs,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up ungraciously enough, and put on my dressing gown. Aunt Selina,
      who had her hair in crimps, tied a veil over her head, and together we
      went to the head of the stairs. Aunt Selina leaned far over and peered
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the library,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I can see a light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lust of battle was in Aunt Selina&rsquo;s eye. She girded her robe about her
      and began to descend the stairs cautiously. We went through the hall and
      stopped at the library door. It was empty, but from the den beyond came a
      hum of voices and the cheerful glow of fire light. I realized the
      situation then, but it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you kiss her in the dining room?&rdquo; Bella was saying in her
      clear, high tones. &ldquo;You did, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only her hand,&rdquo; Jim, desperately explaining. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to pay her
      some attention, under the circumstances. And I give you my word, I was
      thinking of you when I did it.&rdquo; THE WRETCH!
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina drew her breath in suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of marrying Reggie Wolfe.&rdquo; This was Bella, of course. &ldquo;He
      wants me to. He&rsquo;s a dear boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, I will kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so very lonely,&rdquo; Bella sighed. We could hear the creak of Jim&rsquo;s
      shirt bosom that showed that he had sighed also. Aunt Selina had gripped
      me by the arm, and I could hear her breathing hard beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Jim,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she clutched me firmly, and the next thing we heard was another creak,
      louder and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up! Get up off your knees this instant!&rdquo; Bella was saying
      frantically. &ldquo;Some one might come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send me away,&rdquo; Jim said in a smothered voice. &ldquo;Every one in the
      house is asleep, and I love you, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina swallowed hard in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to make love to me,&rdquo; Bella. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s highly
      improper, under the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Jim: &ldquo;You swallow a camel and stick at a gnat. Why did you meet
      me here, if you didn&rsquo;t expect me to make love to you? I&rsquo;ve stood for a
      lot, Bella, but this foolishness will have to end. Either you love me&mdash;or
      you don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m desperate.&rdquo; He drew a long, forlorn breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Jim!&rdquo; This was Bella. A pause. Then&mdash;&ldquo;Let my hand alone!&rdquo;
       Also Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is MY hand!&rdquo;&mdash;Jim&rsquo;s most fatuous tone. &ldquo;THERE is where you wore
      my ring. There&rsquo;s the mark still.&rdquo; Sounds of Jim kissing Bella&rsquo;s ring
      finger. &ldquo;What did you do with it? Throw it away?&rdquo; More sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina crossed the library swiftly, and again I followed. Bella was
      sitting in a low chair by the fire, looking at the logs, in the most
      exquisite negligee of pink chiffon and ribbon. Jim was on his knees,
      staring at her adoringly, and holding both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret,&rdquo; Bella was saying, looking as coy as she knew how&mdash;which
      was considerable. &ldquo;I&mdash;I still wear it, on a chain around my neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a chain around her neck! Bella, who is decollete whenever it is
      allowable, and more than is proper!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the limit of Aunt Selina&rsquo;s endurance. Still holding me, she
      stepped through the doorway and into the firelight, a fearful figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim saw her first. He went quite white and struggled to get up, smiling a
      sickly smile. Bella, after her first surprise, was superbly indifferent.
      She glanced at us, raised her eyebrows, and then looked at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More victims of insomnia!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in? Jim, pull up a
      chair by the fire for your aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina opened her mouth twice, like a fish, before she could speak.
      Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James, I demand that that woman leave the house!&rdquo; she said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bella leaned back and yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James, shall I go?&rdquo; she asked amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Jim said, pulling himself together as best he could. &ldquo;Look
      here, Aunt Selina, you know she can&rsquo;t go out, and what&rsquo;s more, I&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      want her to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;what?&rdquo; Aunt Selina screeched, taking a step forward. &ldquo;You have
      the audacity to say such a thing to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella leaned over and gave the fire log a punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just saying that he shouldn&rsquo;t say such things to me, either,&rdquo; she
      remarked pleasantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll take cold, Miss Caruthers.
      Wouldn&rsquo;t you like a hot sherry flip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina gasped. Then she sat down heavily on one of the carved
      teakwood chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he loved you; I heard him,&rdquo; she said weakly. &ldquo;He&mdash;he was
      going to put his arm around you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Habit!&rdquo; Jim put in, trying to smile. &ldquo;You see, Aunt Selina, it&rsquo;s&mdash;well,
      it&rsquo;s a habit I got into some time ago, and I&mdash;my arm does it without
      my thinking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Habit!&rdquo; Aunt Selina repeated, her voice thick with passion. Then she
      turned to me. &ldquo;Go to your room at once!&rdquo; she said in her most awful tone.
      &ldquo;Go to your room and leave this&mdash;this shocking affair to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But if she had reached her limit, so had I. If Jim chose to ruin himself,
      it was not my fault. Any one with common sense would have known at least
      to close the door before he went down on his knees, no matter to whom. So
      when Aunt Selina turned on me and pointed in the direction of the
      staircase, I did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly wide awake,&rdquo; I said coldly. &ldquo;I shall go to bed when I am
      entirely ready, and not before. And as for Jim&rsquo;s conduct, I do not know
      much about the conventions in such cases, but if he wishes to embrace Miss
      Knowles, and she wants him to, the situation is interesting, but hardly
      novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina rose slowly and drew the folds of her dressing gown around
      her, away from the contamination of my touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo; she demanded hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; I was quite white and stiff from my knees up, but below I was
      wavery. I glanced at Jim for moral support, but he was looking
      idolatrously at Bella. As for her, quite suddenly she had dropped her mask
      of indifference; her face was strained and anxious, and there were deep
      circles I had not seen before, under her eyes. And it was Bella who
      finally threw herself into the breach&mdash;the family breach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all my fault, Miss Caruthers,&rdquo; she said, stepping between Aunt
      Selina and myself. &ldquo;I have been a blind and wicked woman, and I have
      almost wrecked two lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two! What of mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she struggled on, against the glint in Aunt Selina&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      did not realize how much I cared, until it was too late. I did so many
      things that were cruel and wrong&mdash;oh, Jim, Jim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and buried her head on his shoulder and cried; real tears. I
      could hardly believe that it was Bella. And Jim put both his arms around
      her and almost cried, too, and looked nauseatingly happy with the eye he
      turned to Bella, and scared to death out of the one he kept on Aunt
      Selina.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on me, as of course I knew she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said, pointing at Jim and Bella, &ldquo;that shameful picture is due
      to your own indifference. I am not blind; I have seen how you rejected all
      his loving advances.&rdquo; Bella drew away from Jim, but he jerked her back.
      &ldquo;If anything in the world would reconcile me to divorce, it is this
      unbelievable situation. James, are you shameless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But James was and didn&rsquo;t care who knew it. And as there was nothing else
      to do, and no one else to do it, I stood very straight against the door
      frame, and told the whole miserable story from the very beginning. I told
      how Dal and Jim had persuaded me, and how I had weakened and found it was
      too late, and how Bella had come in that night, when she had no business
      to come, and had sat down in the basement kitchen on my hands and almost
      turned me into a raving maniac. As I went on I became fluent; my sense of
      injury grew on me. I made it perfectly clear that I hated them all, and
      that when people got divorces they ought to know their own minds and stay
      divorced. And at that a great light broke on Aunt Selina, who hadn&rsquo;t
      understood until that minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of her principles, she might have been expected to turn on Jim and
      Bella, and disinherit them, and cast them out, figuratively, with the
      flaming sword of her tongue. BUT SHE DID NOT!
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on me in the most terrible way, and asked me how I dared to
      come between husband and wife, because divorce or no divorce, whom God
      hath joined together, and so on. And when Jim picked up his courage in
      both hands and tried to interfere, she pushed him back with one hand while
      she pointed the other at me and called me a Jezebel.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX. THE HARBISON MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      She talked for an hour, having got between me and the door, and she
      scolded Jim and Bella thoroughly. But they did not hear it, being occupied
      with each other, sitting side by side meekly on the divan with Jim holding
      Bella&rsquo;s hand under a cushion. She said they would have to be very good to
      make up for all the deception, but it was perfectly clear that it was a
      relief to her to find that I didn&rsquo;t belong to her permanently, and as I
      have said before, she was crazy about Bella.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat back in a chair and grew comfortably drowsy in the monotony of her
      voice. It was a name that brought me to myself with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harbison!&rdquo; Aunt Selina was saying. &ldquo;Then bring him down at once,
      James. I want no more deception. There is no use cleaning a house and
      leaving a dirty corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be necessary for me to stay and see it swept,&rdquo; I said,
      mustering the rags she had left of my self-respect, and trying to pass
      her. But she planted herself squarely before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can not stir up a dust like this, young woman, and leave other people
      to sneeze in it,&rdquo; she said grimly. And I stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat, very small, on a chair in a corner. I felt like Jezebel, or
      whatever her name was, and now the Harbison man was coming, and he was
      going to see me stripped of my pretensions to domesticity and of a husband
      who neglected me. He was going to see me branded a living lie, and he
      would hate me because I had put him in a ridiculous position. He was just
      the sort to resent being ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim brought him down in a dressing gown and a state of bewilderment. It
      was plain that the memory of the afternoon still rankled, for he was very
      short with Jim and inclined to resent the whole thing. The clock in the
      hall chimed half after three as they came down the stairs, and I heard Mr.
      Harbison stumble over something in the darkness and say that if it was a
      joke, he wasn&rsquo;t in the humor for it. To which Jim retorted that it wasn&rsquo;t
      anything resembling a joke, and for heaven&rsquo;s sake not to walk on his feet;
      he couldn&rsquo;t get around the furniture any faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the den Mr. Harbison stopped, blinking in the light. Then,
      when he saw us, he tried to back himself and his dishabille out into the
      obscurity of the library. But Aunt Selina was too quick for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;I want you, young man. It seems that there are
      only two fools in the house, and you are one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He straightened at that and looked bewildered, but he tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was the only one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it possible that there is
      another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the other,&rdquo; she announced. I think she expected him to say
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; but, whatever he was, he was never banal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; he asked politely, trying to be interested and to understand
      at the same time. He had not seen me. He was gazing fixedly at Bella,
      languishing on the divan and watching him with lowered lids, and he had
      given Jim a side glance of contempt. But now he saw me and he colored
      under his tan. His neck blushed furiously, being much whiter than his
      face. He kept his eyes on mine, and I knew that he was mutely asking
      forgiveness. But the thought of what was coming paralyzed me. My eyes were
      glued to his as they had been that first evening when he had called me
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilson,&rdquo; and after an instant he looked away, and his face was set
      and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that we have all been playing a little comedy, Mr. Harbison,&rdquo;
       Aunt Selina began, nasally sarcastic. &ldquo;Or rather, you and I have been the
      audience. The rest have played.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I understand,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I have seen very
      little comedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not well planned,&rdquo; Aunt Selina retorted tartly. &ldquo;The idea was
      good, but the young person who was playing the part of Mrs. Wilson&mdash;overacted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, Aunt Selina,&rdquo; Jim protested, &ldquo;Kit was coaxed and cajoled into
      this thing. Give me fits if you like; I deserve all I get. But let Kit
      alone&mdash;she did it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella looked over at me and smiled nastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would stop doing things for Jim, Kit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is SO
      unprofitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Harbison harked back to Aunt Selina&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PLAYING the part of Mrs. Wilson!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Playing the part. She is not Mrs. Wilson. It seems that that
      honor belonged at one time to Miss Knowles. I believe such things are not
      unknown in New York, only why in the name of sense does a man want to
      divorce a woman and then meet her at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning to kiss
      the place where his own wedding ring used to rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim fidgeted. Bella was having spasms of mirth to herself, but the
      Harbison man did not smile. He stood for a moment looking at the fire;
      then he thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his dressing gown, and
      stalked over to me. He did not care that the others were watching and
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; he demanded, staring down at me. &ldquo;You are NOT Mrs. Wilson?
      You are not married at all? All that about being neglected&mdash;and
      loathing HIM, and all that on the roof&mdash;there was no foundation of
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could only shake my head without looking up. There was no defense to be
      made. Oh, I deserved the scorn in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&mdash;they persuaded you, I suppose, and it was to help somebody? It
      was not a practical joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I rallied a little spirit at that. It had been anything but a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;but&mdash;you could have saved me
      something. I must have given you all a great deal of amusement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;I&mdash;I want to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he deliberately left me and went over to the door. There he turned and
      looked down at Aunt Selina. He was a little white, but there was no
      passion in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for telling me all this, Miss Caruthers,&rdquo; he said easily. &ldquo;Now
      that you and I know, I&rsquo;m afraid the others will miss their little
      diversion. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, it was all right for Jim to laugh and say that he was only huffed a
      little and would be over it by morning. I knew better. There was something
      queer in his face as he went out. He did not even glance in my direction.
      He had said very little, but he had put me as effectually in the wrong as
      if he had not kissed me&mdash;deliberately kissed me&mdash;that very
      evening, on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not go to sleep again. I lay wretchedly thinking things over and
      trying to remember who Jezebel was, and toward morning I distinctly heard
      the knob of the door turn. I mistrusted my ears, however, and so I got up
      quietly and went over in the darkness. There was no sound outside, but
      when I put my hand on the knob I felt it move under my fingers. The
      counter pressure evidently alarmed whoever it was, for the knob was
      released and nothing more happened. But by this time anything so
      uncomplicated as the fumbling of a knob at night had no power to disturb
      me. I went back to bed.

    <h2>
      Chapter XX. BREAKING OUT IN A NEW PLACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hunger roused everybody early the next morning, Friday. Leila Mercer had
      discovered a box of bonbons that she had forgotten, and we divided them
      around. Aunt Selina asked for the candied fruit and got it&mdash;quite a
      third of the box. We gathered in the lower hall and on the stairs and
      nibbled nauseating sweets while Mr. Harbison examined the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not glance in my direction. Betty and Dal were helping him, and he
      seemed very cheerful. Max sat with me on the stairs. Mr. Harbison had just
      unscrewed the telephone box from the wall and was squinting into it, when
      Bella came downstairs. It was her first appearance, but as she was always
      late, nobody noticed. When she stopped, just above us on the stairs,
      however, we looked up, and she was holding to the rail and trembling
      perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Harbison, will you&mdash;can you come upstairs?&rdquo; she asked. Her voice
      was strained, almost reedy, and her lips were white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison stared up at her, with the telephone box in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, unless it&rsquo;s very important,
      I&rsquo;d like to fix this talking machine. We want to make a food record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to break a food record,&rdquo; Max put in, but Bella created a
      diversion by sitting down suddenly on the stair just above us, and burying
      her face in her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim is sick,&rdquo; she said, with a sob. &ldquo;He&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t want anything to
      eat, and his head aches. He&mdash;said for me&mdash;to go away and let him
      die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dal dropped the hammer immediately, and Lollie Mercer sat petrified, with
      a bonbon halfway to her mouth. For, of course, it was unexpected, finding
      sentiment of any kind in Bella, and none of them knew about the scene in
      the den in the small hours of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick!&rdquo; Aunt Selina said, from a hall chair. &ldquo;Sick! Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All over,&rdquo; Bella quavered. &ldquo;His poor head is hot, and he&rsquo;s thirsty, but
      he doesn&rsquo;t want anything but water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; Dal said suddenly. &ldquo;Suppose he should&mdash;Bella, are you
      telling us ALL his symptoms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bella put down her handkerchief and got up. From her position on the
      stairs she looked down on us with something of her old haughty manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is ill, you may blame yourselves, all of you,&rdquo; she said cruelly.
      &ldquo;You taunted him with being&mdash;fat, and laughed at him, until he
      stopped eating the things he should eat. And he has been exercising&mdash;on
      the roof, until he has worn himself out. And now&mdash;he is ill. He&mdash;he
      has a rash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody jumped at that, and we instinctively moved away from Bella. She
      was quite cold and scornful by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rash!&rdquo; Max exclaimed. &ldquo;What sort of rash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see it,&rdquo; Bella said with dignity, and turning, she went up the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of excitement, and nobody except Mr. Harbison was
      willing to go near Jim. He went up at once with Bella, while Max and Dal
      sat cravenly downstairs and wondered if we would all take it, and Anne
      told about a man she knew who had it, and was deaf and dumb and blind when
      he recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison came down after a while, and said that the rash was there,
      right enough, and that Jim absolutely refused to be quarantined; that he
      insisted that he always got a rash from early strawberries and that if he
      DID have anything, since they were so touchy he hoped they would all get
      it. If they locked him in he would kick the door down.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a long conference in the hall, with Bella sitting red-eyed and
      objecting to every suggestion we made. And finally we arranged to shut Jim
      up in one of the servants&rsquo; bedrooms with a sheet wrung out of disinfectant
      hung over the door. Bella said she would sit outside in the hall and read
      to him through the closed door, so finally he gave a grudging consent. But
      he was in an awful humor. Max and Dal put on rubber gloves and helped him
      over, and they said afterward that the way he talked was fearful. And
      there was a telephone in the maid&rsquo;s room, and he kept asking for things
      every five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor came he said it was too early to tell positively, and he
      ordered him liquid diet and said he would be back that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which&mdash;the diet&mdash;takes me back to the famine. After they had
      moved Jim, Mr. Harbison went back to the telephone, and found everything
      as it should be. So he followed the telephone wire, and the rest followed
      him. I did not; he had systematically ignored me all morning, after having
      dared to kiss me the night before. And any other man I know, after looking
      at me the way he had looked a dozen times, would have been at least
      reasonably glad to find me free and unmarried. But it was clear that he
      was not; I wondered if he was the kind of man who always makes love to the
      other man&rsquo;s wife and runs like mad when she is left a widow, or gets a
      divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just when I had decided that I hated him, and that there was one man I
      knew who would never make love to a woman whom he thought married and then
      be very dignified and aloof when he found she wasn&rsquo;t, I heard what was
      wrong with the telephone wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been cut! Cut through with a pair of silver manicure scissors from
      the dressing table in Bella&rsquo;s room, where Aunt Selina slept! The wire had
      been clipped where it came into the house, just under a window, and the
      scissors still lay on the sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was mysterious enough, but no one was interested in the mystery just
      then. We wanted food, and wanted it at once. Mr. Harbison fixed the wire,
      and the first thing we did, of course, was to order something to eat. Aunt
      Selina went to bed just after luncheon with indigestion, to the relief of
      every one in the house. She had been most unpleasant all morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she found herself ill, however, she insisted on having Bella, and
      that made trouble at once. We found Bella with her cheek against the door
      into Jim&rsquo;s room, looking maudlin while he shouted love messages to her
      from the other side. At first she refused to stir, but after Anne and Max
      had tried and failed, the rest of us went to her in a body and implored
      her. We said Aunt Selina was in awful shape&mdash;which she was, as to
      temper&mdash;and that she had thrown a mustard plaster at Anne, which was
      true.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Bella went, grumbling, and Jim was a maniac. We had not thought it
      would be so bad for Bella, but Aunt Selina fell asleep soon after she took
      charge, holding Bella&rsquo;s hand, and slept for three hours and never let go!
    </p>
    <p>
      About two that afternoon the sun came out, and the rest of us went to the
      roof. The sleet had melted and the air was fairly warm. Two housemaids
      dusting rugs on the top of the next house came over and stared at us, and
      somebody in an automobile down on Riverside Drive stood up and waved at
      us. It was very cheerful and hopelessly lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed on the roof after the others had gone, and for some time I
      thought I was alone. After a while, I got a whiff of smoke, and then I saw
      Mr. Harbison far over in the corner, one foot on the parapet, moodily
      smoking a pipe. He was gazing out over the river, and paying no attention
      to me. This was natural, considering that I had hardly spoken to him all
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not let him drive me away, so I sat still, and it grew darker and
      colder. He filled his pipe now and then, but he never looked in my
      direction. Finally, however, as it grew very dusk, he knocked the ashes
      out and came toward me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to make a request, Miss McNair,&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;Please keep
      off the roof after sunset. There are&mdash;reasons.&rdquo; I had risen and was
      preparing to go downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I know the reasons, I refuse to do anything of the kind,&rdquo; I
      retorted. He bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the door will be kept locked,&rdquo; he rejoined, and opened it for me. He
      did not follow me, but stood watching until I was down, and I heard him
      close the roof door firmly behind me.

      Chapter XXI. A BAR OF SOAP
    </h2>
    <p>
      Late that evening Betty Mercer and Dallas were writing verses of
      condolence to be signed by all of us and put under the door into Jim&rsquo;s
      room when Bella came running down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dal was reading the first verse when she came. &ldquo;Listen to this, Bella,&rdquo; he
      said triumphantly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;There was a fat artist named Jas,
     Who cruelly called his friends nas.
     When, altho&rsquo; shut up tight,
     He broke out over night
     With a rash that is maddening, he clas.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then he caught sight of Bella&rsquo;s face as she stood in the doorway, and
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim is delirious!&rdquo; she announced tragically. &ldquo;You shut him in there all
      alone and now he&rsquo;s delirious. I&rsquo;ll never forgive any of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delirious!&rdquo; everybody exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was sane enough when I took him his chicken broth,&rdquo; Mr. Harbison said.
      &ldquo;He was almost fluent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is stark, staring crazy,&rdquo; Bella insisted hysterically. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      locked the door carefully when I went down to my dinner, and when I came
      up it&mdash;it was unlocked, and Jim was babbling on the bed, with a sheet
      over his face. He&mdash;he says the house is haunted and he wants all the
      men to come up and sit in the room with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on your life,&rdquo; Max said. &ldquo;I am young, and my career has only begun. I
      don&rsquo;t intend to be cut off in the flower of my youth. But I&rsquo;ll tell you
      what I will do; I&rsquo;ll take him a drink. I can tie it to a pole or
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Harbison did not smile. He was thoughtful for a minute. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he is delirious,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;and I wouldn&rsquo;t be
      surprised if he has happened on something that&mdash;will be of general
      interest. I think I will stay with him tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, of course, none of the others would confess that he was
      afraid, so with the South American leading, they all went upstairs. The
      women of the party sat on the lower steps and listened, but everything was
      quiet. Now and then we could hear the sound of voices, and after a while
      there was a rapid slamming of doors and the sound of some one running down
      to the second floor. Then quiet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of us felt talkative. Bella had followed the men up and had been put
      out, and sat sniffling by herself in the den. Aunt Selina was working over
      a jig-saw puzzle in the library, and declaring that some of it must be
      lost. Anne and Leila Mercer were embroidering, and Betty and I sat idle,
      our hands in our laps. The whole atmosphere of the house was mysterious.
      Anne told over again of the strange noises the night her necklace was
      stolen. Betty asked me about the time when the comfort slipped from under
      my fingers. And when, in the midst of the story, the telephone rang, we
      all jumped and shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour or so they sent for Flannigan, and he went upstairs. He came
      down again soon, however, and returned with something over his arm that
      looked like a rope. It seemed to be made of all kinds of things tied
      together, trunk straps, clothesline, bed sheets, and something that
      Flannigan pointed to with rage and said he hadn&rsquo;t been able to keep his
      clothes on all day. He refused to explain further, however, and trailed
      the nondescript article up the stairs. We could only gaze after him and
      wonder what it all meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclave lasted far into the night. The feminine contingent went to
      bed, but not to sleep. Some time after midnight, Mr. Harbison and Max went
      downstairs and I could hear them rattling around testing windows and
      burglar alarms. But finally every one settled down and the rest of the
      night was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty Mercer came into my room the next morning, Sunday, and said Anne
      Brown wanted me. I went over at once, and Anne was sitting up in bed,
      crying. Dal had slipped out of the room at daylight, she said, and hadn&rsquo;t
      come back. He had thought she was asleep, but she wasn&rsquo;t, and she knew he
      was dead, for nothing ever made Dal get up on Sunday before noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one moving in the house, and I hardly knew what to do. It was
      Betty who said she would go up and rouse Mr. Harbison and Max, who had
      taken Jim&rsquo;s place in the studio. She started out bravely enough, but in a
      minute we heard her flying back. Anne grew perfectly white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying on the upper stairs!&rdquo; Betty cried, and we all ran out. It was
      quite true. Dal was lying on the stairs in a bathrobe, with one of Jim&rsquo;s
      Indian war clubs in his hand. And he was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked somewhat embarrassed when he roused and saw us standing around.
      He said he was going to play a practical joke on somebody and fell asleep
      in the middle of it. And Anne said he wasn&rsquo;t even an intelligent liar, and
      went back to bed in a temper. But Betty came in with me, and we sat and
      looked at each other and didn&rsquo;t say much. The situation was beyond us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor let Jim out the next day, there having been nothing the matter
      with him but a stomach rash. But Jim was changed; he mooned around Bella,
      of course, as before, but he was abstracted at times, and all that day&mdash;Sunday&mdash;he
      wandered off by himself, and one would come across him unexpectedly in the
      basement or along some of the unused back halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina held service that morning. Jim said that he always had a
      prayer book, but that he couldn&rsquo;t find anything with so many people in the
      house. So Aunt Selina read some religious poetry out of the newspapers,
      and gave us a valuable talk on Deception versus Honesty, with me as the
      illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost everybody took a nap after luncheon. I stayed in the den and read
      Ibsen, and felt very mournful. And after Hedda had shot herself, I lay
      down on the divan and cried a little&mdash;over Hedda; she was young and
      it was such a tragic ending&mdash;and then I fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I wakened Mr. Harbison was standing by the table, and he held my book
      in his hands. In view of the armed neutrality between us, I expected to
      see him bow to me curtly, turn on his heel and leave the room. Indeed,
      considering his state of mind the night before, I should hardly have been
      surprised if he had thrown Hedda at my head. (This is not a pun. I detest
      them.) But instead, when he heard me move he glanced over at me and even
      smiled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t worth it,&rdquo; he said, indicating the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your tears. You were crying over it, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very unhappy,&rdquo; I asserted indifferently. &ldquo;She was married and she
      loved some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think she did?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And even so, was that a reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other man cared for her; he may not have been able to help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he knew that she was married,&rdquo; he said virtuously, and then he caught
      my eye and he saw the analogy instantly, for he colored hotly and put down
      the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most men argue that way,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They argue by the book, and&mdash;they
      do as they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up a Japanese ivory paper weight from the table, and stood
      balancing it across his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfectly right,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I deserve it all. My
      grievance is at myself. Your&mdash;your beauty, and the fact that I
      thought you were unhappy, put me&mdash;beside myself. It is not an excuse;
      it is a weak explanation. I will not forget myself again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was as abject as any one could have wished. It was my minute of
      triumph, but I can not pretend that I was happy. Evidently it had been
      only a passing impulse. If he had really cared, now that he knew I was
      free, he would have forgotten himself again at once. Then a new
      explanation occurred to me. Suppose it had been Bella all the time, and
      the real shock had been to find that she had been married!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fault of the situation was really mine,&rdquo; I said magnanimously; &ldquo;I
      quite blame myself. Only, you must believe one thing. You never furnished
      us any amusement.&rdquo; I looked at him sidewise. &ldquo;The discovery that Bella and
      Jim were once married must have been a great shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a surprise,&rdquo; he replied evenly. His voice and his eyes were
      inscrutable. He returned my glance steadily. It was infuriating to have
      gone half-way to meet him, as I had, and then to find him intrenched in
      his self-sufficiency again. I got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfortunate that our acquaintance has begun so unfavorably,&rdquo; I
      remarked, preparing to pass him. &ldquo;Under other circumstances we might have
      been friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one solace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When we do not have friends, we can
      not lose them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door to let me pass out, and as our eyes met, all the
      coldness died out of his. He held out his hand, but I was hurt. I refused
      to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kit!&rdquo; he said unsteadily. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m an obstinate, pig-headed brute. I
      am sorry. Can&rsquo;t we be friends, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;When we do not have friends we can not lose them,&rsquo;&rdquo; I replied with cool
      malice. And the next instant the door closed behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that night that the really serious event of the quarantine
      occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were gathered in the library, and everybody was deadly dull. Aunt
      Selina said she had been reared to a strict observance of the Sabbath, and
      she refused to go to bed early. The cards and card tables were put away
      and every one sat around and quarreled and was generally nasty, except
      Bella and Jim, who had gone into the den just after dinner and firmly
      closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it was just after Max proposed to me. Yes, he proposed to me again
      that night. He said that Jim&rsquo;s illness had decided him; that any of us
      might take sick and die, shut in that contaminated atmosphere, and that if
      he did he wanted it all settled. And whether I took him or not he wanted
      me to remember him kindly if anything happened. I really hated to refuse
      him&mdash;he was in such deadly earnest. But it was quite unnecessary for
      him to have blamed his refusal, as he did, on Mr. Harbison. I am sure I
      had refused him plenty of times before I had ever heard of the man. Yes,
      it was just after he proposed to me that Flannigan came to the door and
      called Mr. Harbison out into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flannigan&mdash;like most of the people in the house&mdash;always went to
      Mr. Harbison when there was anything to be done. He openly adored him, and&mdash;what
      was more&mdash;he did what Mr. Harbison ordered without a word, while the
      rest of us had to get down on our knees and beg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison went out, muttering something about a storm coming up, and
      seeing that the tent was secure. Betty Mercer went with him. She had been
      at his heels all evening, and called him &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; on every possible occasion.
      Indeed, she made no secret of it; she said that she was mad about him, and
      that she would love to live in South America, and have an Indian squaw for
      a lady&rsquo;s maid, and sit out on the veranda in the evenings and watch the
      Southern Cross shooting across the sky, and eat tropical food from the
      quaint Indian pottery. She was not even daunted when Dal told her the
      Southern Cross did not shoot, and that the food was probably canned corn
      on tin dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Betty went with him. She wore a pale yellow dinner gown, with just a
      sophisticated touch of black here and there, and cut modestly square in
      the neck. Her shoulders are scrawny. And after they were gone&mdash;not
      her shoulders; Mr. Harbison and she&mdash;Aunt Selina announced that the
      next day was Monday, that she had only a week&rsquo;s supply of clothing with
      her, and that no policeman who ever swung a mace should wash her
      undergarments for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, but nobody offered to do it. Anne was reading De
      Maupassant under cover of a table, and the rest pretended not to hear.
      After a pause, Aunt Selina got up heavily and went upstairs, coming down
      soon after with a bundle covered with a green shawl, and with a white
      balbriggan stocking trailing from an opening in it. She paused at the
      library door, surveyed the inmates, caught my unlucky eye and beckoned to
      me with a relentless forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can put them to soak tonight,&rdquo; she confided to me, &ldquo;and tomorrow they
      will be quite simple to do. There is no lace to speak of&rdquo;&mdash;Dal raised
      his eyebrows&mdash;&ldquo;and very little flouncing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina and I went to the laundry. It never occurred to any one that
      Bella should have gone; she had stepped into all my privileges&mdash;such
      as they were&mdash;and assumed none of my obligations. Aunt Selina and I
      went to the laundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange what big things develop from little ones. In this case it
      was a bar of soap. And if Flannigan had used as much soap as he should
      have instead of washing up the kitchen floor with cold dish water, it
      would have developed sooner. The two most unexpected events of the whole
      quarantine occurred that night at the same time, one on the roof and one
      in the cellar. The cellar one, although curious, was not so serious as the
      other, so it comes first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina put her clothes in a tub in the laundry and proceeded to dress
      them like a vegetable. She threw in a handful of salt, some kerosene oil
      and a little ammonia. The result was villainous, but after she tasted it&mdash;or
      snuffed it&mdash;she said it needed a bar of soap cut up to give it
      strength&mdash;or flavor&mdash;and I went into the store room for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laundry soap was in a box. I took in a silver fork, for I hated to
      touch the stuff, and jabbed a bar successfully in the semi-darkness. Then
      I carried it back to the laundry and dropped it on the table. Aunt Selina
      looked at the fork with disgust; then we both looked at the soap. ONE SIDE
      OF IT WAS COVERED WITH ROUND HOLES THAT CURVED AROUND ON EACH OTHER LIKE A
      COILED SNAKE.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran back to the store room, and there, a little bit sticky and smelling
      terribly of rosin, lay Anne&rsquo;s pearl necklace!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so excited that I seized Aunt Selina by the hands and danced her all
      over the place. Then I left her, trying to find her hair pins on the
      floor, and ran up to tell the others. I met Betty in the hall and waved
      the pearls at her. But she did not notice them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Harbison down there?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly. &ldquo;I left him on the
      roof and went down to my room for my scarf, and when I went back he had
      disappeared. He&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in the house.&rdquo; She tried to
      laugh, but her voice was shaky. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have got down without passing
      me, anyhow,&rdquo; she supplemented. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m silly, but so many queer
      things have happened, Kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry, Betty,&rdquo; I soothed her. &ldquo;He is big enough to take care
      of himself. And with the best intentions in the world, you can&rsquo;t have him
      all the time, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was too much startled to be indignant. She followed me into the
      library, where the sight of the pearls produced a tremendous excitement,
      and then every one had to go down to the store room, and see where the
      necklace had been hidden, and Max examined all the bars of soap for thumb
      prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison did not appear. Max commented on the fact caustically, but
      Dal hushed him up. And so, Anne hugging her pearls, and Aunt Selina having
      put a final seasoning of washing powder on the clothes in the tub, we all
      went upstairs to bed. It had been a long day, and the morning would at
      least bring bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was almost ready for bed when Jim tapped at my door. I had been very
      cool to him since the night in the library when I was publicly staked and
      martyred, and he was almost cringing when I opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; I asked cruelly. &ldquo;Has Bella tired of it already, or has
      somebody else a rash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a shrew, Kit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything. I only&mdash;when
      did you see Harbison last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean &lsquo;last,&rsquo;&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t seen the last of
      him yet.&rdquo; Then I saw that he was really worried. &ldquo;Betty was leading him to
      the roof,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;Why? Is he missing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t anywhere in the house. Dal and I have been over every inch of
      it.&rdquo; Max had come up, in a dressing gown, and was watching me insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we have seen the last of him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Kit, to nip
      the little romance in the bud. The fellow was crazy about you&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      no doubt of it. But I&rsquo;ve been watching him from the beginning, and I think
      I&rsquo;m upheld. Whether he went down the water spout, or across a board to the
      next house&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I dislike him intensely,&rdquo; I said angrily, &ldquo;but you would not dare
      to say that to his face. He could strangle you with one hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max laughed disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I only hope he is gone,&rdquo; he threw at me over his shoulder, &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t want to be responsible to your father if he had stayed.&rdquo; I was
      speechless with wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went away then, and I could hear them going over the house. At one
      o&rsquo;clock Jim went up to bed, the last, and Mr. Harbison had not been found.
      I did not see how they could go to bed at all. If he had escaped, then Max
      was right and the whole thing was heart-breaking. And if he had not, then
      he might be lying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up and dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early part of the night had been cloudy, but when I got to the roof it
      was clear starlight. The wind blew through the electric wires strung
      across and set them singing. The occasional bleat of a belated automobile
      on the drive below came up to me raucously. The tent gleamed, a starlit
      ghost of itself, and the boxwoods bent in the breeze. I went over to the
      parapet and leaned my elbows on it. I had done the same thing so often
      before; I had carried all my times of stress so infallibly to that
      particular place, that instinctively my feet turned there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there in the starlight, I went over the whole serio-comedy, and I
      loathed my part in it. He had been perfectly right to be angry with me and
      with all of us. And I had been a hypocrite and a Pharisee, and had thanked
      God that I was not as other people, when the fact was that I was worse
      than the worst. And although it wasn&rsquo;t dignified to think of him going
      down the drain pipe, still&mdash;no one could blame him for wanting to get
      away from us, and he was quite muscular enough to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in the depths of self-abasement when I heard a sound behind me. It
      was a long breath, quite audible, that ended in a groan. I gripped the
      parapet and listened, while my heart pounded, and in a minute it came
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was terribly frightened. Then&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how I did it, but I was
      across the roof, kneeling beside the tent, where it stood against the
      chimney. And there, lying prone among the flower pots, and almost entirely
      hidden, lay the man we had been looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was toward me, and I reached out shakingly and touched his face.
      It was cold, and my hand, when I drew it back, was covered with blood.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXII. IT WAS DELIRIUM
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was sure he was dead. He did not move, and when I caught his hands and
      called him frantically, he did not hear me. And so, with the horror over
      me, I half fell down the stairs and roused Jim in the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all came with lights and blankets, and they carried him into the tent
      and put him on the couch and tried to put whisky in his mouth. But he
      could not swallow. And the silence became more and more ominous until
      finally Anne got hysterical and cried, &ldquo;He is dead! Dead!&rdquo; and collapsed
      on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not. Just as the lights in the tent began to have red rings
      around them and Jim&rsquo;s voice came from away across the river, somebody
      said, &ldquo;There, he swallowed that,&rdquo; and soon after, he opened his eyes. He
      muttered something that sounded like &ldquo;Andean pinnacle&rdquo; and lapsed into
      unconsciousness again. But he was not dead! He was not dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor came they made a stretcher out of one of Jim&rsquo;s six-foot
      canvases&mdash;it had a picture on it, and Jim was angry enough the next
      day&mdash;and took him down to the studio. We made it as much like a
      sick-room as we could, and we tried to make him comfortable. But he lay
      without opening his eyes, and at dawn the doctor brought a consultant and
      a trained nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was an offensively capable person. She put us all out, and
      scolded Anne for lighting Japanese incense in the room&mdash;although Anne
      explained that it is very reviving. And she said that it was unnecessary
      to have a dozen people breathing up all the oxygen and asphyxiating the
      patient. She was good-looking, too. I disliked her at once. Any one could
      see by the way she took his pulse&mdash;just letting his poor hand hang,
      without any support&mdash;that she was a purely mechanical creature,
      without heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, as I said before, she put us all out, and shut the door, and asked
      us not to whisper outside. Then, too, she refused to allow any flowers in
      the room, although Betty had got a florist out of bed to order some.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consultant came, stayed an hour, and left. Aunt Selina, who proved
      herself a trump in that trying time, waylaid him in the hall, and he said
      it might be a fractured skull, although it was possibly only concussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men spent most of the morning together in the den, with the door shut.
      Now and then one of them would tiptoe upstairs, ask the nurse how her
      patient was doing, and creak down again. Just before noon they all went to
      the roof and examined again the place where he had been found. I know, for
      I was in the upper hall outside the studio. I stayed there almost all day,
      and after a while the nurse let me bring her things as she needed them. I
      don&rsquo;t know why mother didn&rsquo;t let me study nursing&mdash;I always wanted to
      do it. And I felt helpless and childish now, when there were things to be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max came down from the roof alone, and I cornered him in the upper hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going crazy, Max,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Nobody will tell me anything, and I can&rsquo;t
      stand it. How was he hurt? Who hurt him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max looked at me quite a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m darned if I understand you, Kit,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;You said you
      disliked Harbison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do&mdash;I did,&rdquo; I supplemented. &ldquo;But whether I like him or not has
      nothing to do with it. He has been injured&mdash;perhaps murdered&rdquo;&mdash;I
      choked a little. &ldquo;Which&mdash;which of you did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Max took my hand and held it, looking down at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could have cared for me like that,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Dear
      little girl, we don&rsquo;t know who hurt him. I didn&rsquo;t, if that&rsquo;s what you
      mean. Perhaps a flower pot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to cry then, and he drew me to him and let me cry on his arm. He
      stood very quietly, patting my head in a brotherly way and behaving very
      well, save that once he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry too long, Kit; I can stand only a certain amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And just then the nurse opened the door to the studio, and with Max&rsquo;s arm
      still around me, I raised my head and looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harbison was conscious. His eyes were open, and he was staring at us
      both as we stood framed by the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay back at once and closed his eyes, and the nurse shut the door.
      There was no use, even if I had been allowed in, in trying to explain to
      him. To attempt such a thing would have been to presume that he was
      interested in an explanation. I thought bitterly to myself as I brought
      the nurse cracked ice and struggled to make beef tea in the kitchen, that
      lives had been wrecked on less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dal was allowed ten minutes in the sick room during the afternoon, and he
      came out looking puzzled and excited. He refused to tell us what he had
      learned, however, and the rest of the afternoon he and Jim spent in the
      cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day dragged on. Downstairs people ate and read and wrote letters, and
      outside newspaper men talked together and gazed over at the house and
      photographed the doctors coming in and the doctors going out. As for me,
      in the intervals of bringing things, I sat in Bella&rsquo;s chair in the upper
      hall, and listened to the crackle of the nurse&rsquo;s starched skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight that night the doctors made a thorough examination. When they
      came out they were smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is doing very well,&rdquo; the younger one said&mdash;he was hairy and dark,
      but he was beautiful to me. &ldquo;He is entirely conscious now, and in about an
      hour you can send the nurse off for a little sleep. Don&rsquo;t let him talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so at last I went through the familiar door into an unfamiliar room,
      with basins and towels and bottles around, and a screen made of Jim&rsquo;s
      largest canvases. And someone on the improvised bed turned and looked at
      me. He did not speak, and I sat down beside him. After a while he put his
      hand over mine as it lay on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are much better to me than I deserve,&rdquo; he said softly. And because
      his eyes were disconcerting, I put an ice cloth over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better than you deserve,&rdquo; I said, and patted the ice cloth to place
      gently. He fumbled around until he found my hand again, and we were quiet
      for a long time. I think he dozed, for he roused suddenly and pulled the
      cloth from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;the day is all confused,&rdquo; he said, turning to look at me, &ldquo;but&mdash;one
      thing seems to stand out from everything else. Perhaps it was delirium,
      but I seemed to see that door over there open, and you, outside, with&mdash;with
      Max. His arms were around you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was delirium,&rdquo; I said softly. It was my final lie in that house of
      mendacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a satisfied breath, and lifting my hand, held it to his lips and
      kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe it is you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have to hold firmly to your
      hand or you will disappear. Can&rsquo;t you move your chair closer? You are
      miles away.&rdquo; So I did it, for he was not to be excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you to do this. I have been desperately sorry, Kit,
      about the other night. It was a ruffianly thing to do&mdash;to kiss you,
      when I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to keep very still,&rdquo; I reminded him. He kissed my hand again, but
      he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was mad&mdash;crazy.&rdquo; I tried to give him some medicine, but he pushed
      the spoon aside. &ldquo;You will have to listen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am in the depths
      of self-disgust. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think of anything else. You see, you
      seemed so convinced that I was the blackguard that somehow nothing seemed
      to matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten it all,&rdquo; I declared generously, &ldquo;and I would be quite
      willing to be friends, only, you remember you said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; his voice was suddenly reckless, and he raised on his elbow.
      &ldquo;Friends! Who wants to be friends? Kit, I was almost delirious that night.
      The instant I held you in my arms&mdash;It was all over. I loved you the
      first time I saw you. I&mdash;I suppose I&rsquo;m a fool to talk like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, of course, just then Dallas had to open the door and step into the
      room. He was covered with dirt and he had a hatchet in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rope!&rdquo; he demanded, without paying any attention to us and diving into
      corners of the room. &ldquo;Good heavens, isn&rsquo;t there a rope in this confounded
      house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and rushed out, without any explanation, and left us staring at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother the rope!&rdquo; I found myself forced to look into two earnest eyes.
      &ldquo;Kit, were you VERY angry when I kissed you that night on the roof?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I maintained stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then prepare yourself for another attack of rage!&rdquo; he said. And Betty
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had on a fetching pale blue dressing gown, and one braid of her yellow
      hair was pulled carelessly over her shoulder. When she saw me on my knees
      beside the bed (oh, yes, I forgot to say that, quite unconsciously, I had
      slid into that position) she stopped short, just inside the door, and put
      her hand to her throat. She stood for quite a perceptible time looking at
      us, and I tried to rise. But Tom shamelessly put his arm around my
      shoulders and held me beside him. Then Betty took a step back and steadied
      herself by the door frame. She had really cared, I knew then, but I was
      too excited to be sorry for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon for coming in,&rdquo; she said nervously. &ldquo;But&mdash;they
      want you downstairs, Kit. At least, I thought you would want to go, but&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then from the lower part of the house came a pandemonium of noises;
      women screaming, men shouting, and the sound of hatchet strokes and
      splintering wood. I seized Betty by the arm, and together we rushed down
      the stairs.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIII. COMING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The second floor was empty. A table lay overturned at the top of the
      stairs, and a broken flower vase was weltering in its own ooze. Part way
      down Betty stepped on something sharp, that proved to be the Japanese
      paper knife from the den. I left her on the stairs examining her foot and
      hurried to the lower floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here everything was in the utmost confusion. Aunt Selina had fainted, and
      was sitting in a hall chair with her head rolled over sidewise and the
      poker from the library fireplace across her knees. No one was paying any
      attention to her. And Jim was holding the front door open, while three of
      the guards hesitated in the vestibule. The noises continued from the back
      of the house, and as I stood on the lowest stair Bella came out from the
      dining room, with her face streaked with soot, and carrying a kettle of
      hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she called wildly. &ldquo;While Max and Dal are below, you can pour this
      down from the top. It&rsquo;s boiling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim glanced back over his shoulder. &ldquo;Carry out your own murderous
      designs,&rdquo; he said. And then, as she started back with it, &ldquo;Bella, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;have you gone stark mad? Put that kettle
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did it sulkily and Jim turned to the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it was a false alarm before,&rdquo; he explained patiently, &ldquo;but
      this is genuine. It is just as I tell you. Yes, Flannigan is in the house
      somewhere, but he&rsquo;s hiding, I guess. We could manage the thing very well
      ourselves, but we have no cartridges for our revolvers.&rdquo; Then as the noise
      from the rear redoubled, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come in and help, I will telephone
      for the fire department,&rdquo; he concluded emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran to Aunt Selina and tried to straighten her head. In a moment she
      opened her eyes, sat up and stared around her. She saw the kettle at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing with boiling water on the floor?&rdquo; she said to me, with
      her returning voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know you will spoil the floor?&rdquo; The ruling
      passion was strong with Aunt Selina, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not find out the trouble from any one; people appeared and
      disappeared, carrying strange articles. Anne with a rope, Dal with his
      hatchet, Bella and the kettle, but I could get a coherent explanation from
      no one. When the guards finally decided that Jim was in earnest, and that
      the rest of us were not crawling out a rear window while he held them at
      the door, they came in, three of them and two reporters, and Jim led them
      to the butler&rsquo;s pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we found Anne, very white and shaky, with the pantry table and two
      chairs piled against the door of the kitchen slide, and clutching the
      chamois-skin bag that held her jewels. She had a bottle of burgundy open
      beside her, and was pouring herself a glass with shaking hands when we
      appeared. She was furious at Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I very nearly fainted,&rdquo; she said hysterically. &ldquo;I might have been
      murdered, and no one would have cared. I wish they would stop that
      chopping, I&rsquo;m so nervous I could scream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim took the Burgundy from her with one hand and pointed the police to the
      barricaded door with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the door to the dumb-waiter shaft,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The lower one is
      fastened on the inside, in some manner. The noises commenced about eleven
      o&rsquo;clock, while Mr. Brown was on guard. There were scraping sounds first,
      and later the sound of a falling body. He roused Mr. Reed and myself, but
      when we examined the shaft everything was quiet, and dark. We tried
      lowering a candle on a string, but&mdash;it was extinguished from below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporters were busily removing the table and chairs from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have a rope handy,&rdquo; one of them said, &ldquo;I will go down the shaft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Dal says that all reporters should have been policemen, and that all
      policemen are natural newsgatherers.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cage appears to be stuck, half-way between the floors,&rdquo; Jim said.
      &ldquo;They are cutting through the door in the kitchen below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They opened the door then and cautiously peered down, but there was
      nothing to be seen. I touched Jim gingerly on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it Flannigan,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;shut in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he returned absently. &ldquo;Run along and
      don&rsquo;t bother, Kit. He may take to shooting any minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anne and I went out then and shut the door, and went into the dining room
      and sat on our feet, for of course the bullets might come up through the
      floor. Aunt Selina joined us there, and Bella, and the Mercer girls, and
      we sat around and talked in whispers, and Leila Mercer told of the time
      her grandfather had had a struggle with an escaped lunatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the excitement Tom appeared in a bathrobe, looking very
      pale, with a bandage around his head, and the nurse at his heels
      threatening to leave and carrying a bottle of medicine and a spoon. He
      went immediately to the pantry, and soon we could hear him giving orders
      and the rest hurrying around to obey them. The hammering ceased, and the
      silence was even worse. It was more suggestive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about fifteen minutes there was a thud, as if the cage had fallen, and
      the sound of feet rushing down the cellar stairs. Then there were groans
      and loud oaths, and everybody talking at once, below, and the sound of a
      struggle. In the dining room we all sat bent forward, with straining ears
      and quickened breath, until we distinctly heard someone laugh. Then we
      knew that, whatever it was, it was over, and nobody was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds came closer, were coming up the stairs and into the pantry.
      Then the door swung open, and Tom and a policeman appeared in the doorway,
      with the others crowding behind. Between them they supported a grimy,
      unshaven object, covered with whitewash from the wall of the shaft, an
      object that had its hands fastened together with handcuffs, and that
      leered at us with a pair of the most villainously crossed eyes I have ever
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of us had ever seen him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lawrence McGuirk, better known as Tubby,&rsquo;&rdquo; Tom said cheerfully. &ldquo;A
      celebrity in his particular line, which is second-story man and all-round
      rascal. A victim of the quarantine, like ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve missed him for a week,&rdquo; one of the guards said with a grin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
      been real anxious about you, Tubby. Ain&rsquo;t a week goes by, when you&rsquo;re in
      health, that we don&rsquo;t hear something of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McGuirk muttered something under his breath, and the men chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; Tom said, interpreting, &ldquo;that he doesn&rsquo;t like us much. He
      doesn&rsquo;t like the food, and he doesn&rsquo;t like the beds. He says just when he
      got a good place fixed up in the coal cellar, Flannigan found it, and is
      asleep there now, this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Selina rose suddenly and cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo; she asked severely, &ldquo;that from now on we will have
      to add two newspaper reporters, three policemen and a burglar to the
      occupants of this quarantined house? Because, if that is the case, I
      absolutely refuse to feed them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But one of the reporters stepped forward and bowed ceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thank you for your kind invitation, but&mdash;it will
      be impossible for us to accept. I had intended to break the good news
      earlier, but this little game of burglar-in-a-corner prevented me. The
      fact is, your Jap has been discovered to have nothing more serious than
      chicken-pox, and&mdash;if you will forgive a poultry yard joke, there is
      no longer any necessity for your being cooped up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he retired, quite pleased with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One would have thought we had exhausted our capacity for emotion, but Jim
      said a joyful emotion was so new that we hardly knew how to receive it.
      Every one shook hands with every one else, and even the nurse shared in
      the excitement and gave Jim the medicine she had prepared for Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we all sat down and had some champagne, and while they were waiting
      for the police wagon, they gave some to poor McGuirk. He was still quite
      shaken from his experience when the dumb-waiter stuck. The wine cheered
      him a little, and he told his story, in a voice that was creaky from
      disuse, while Tom held my hand under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had a dreadful week, he said; he spent his days in a closet in one
      of the maids&rsquo; rooms&mdash;the one where we had put Jim. It was Jim waking
      out of a nap and declaring that the closet door had moved by itself and
      that something had crawled under his bed and out of the door, that had
      roused the suspicions of the men in the house&mdash;and he slept at night
      on the coal in the cellar. He was actually tearful when he rubbed his hand
      over his scrubby chin, and said he hadn&rsquo;t had a shave for a week. He took
      somebody&rsquo;s razor, he said, but he couldn&rsquo;t get hold of a portable mirror,
      and every time he lathered up and stood in front of the glass in the
      dining room sideboard, some one came and he had had to run and hide. He
      told, too, of his attempts to escape, of the board on the roof, of the
      home-made rope, and the hole in the cellar, and he spoke feelingly of the
      pearl collar and the struggle he had made to hide it. He said that for
      three days it was concealed in the pocket of Jim&rsquo;s old smoking coat in the
      studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all rather sorry for him, but if we had made him uncomfortable,
      think of what he had done to us. And for him to tell, as he did later in
      court, that if that was high society he would rather be a burglar, and
      that we starved him, and that the women had to dress each other because
      they had no lady&rsquo;s maids, and that the whole lot of us were in love with
      one man, it was downright malicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wagon came for him just as he finished his story, and we all went to
      the door. In the vestibule Aunt Selina suddenly remembered something, and
      she stepped forward and caught the poor fellow by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; she said grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you to return what you took from
      ME last Tuesday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McGuirk stared, then shuddered and turned suddenly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;On the stairs to the roof! YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They led him away then, quite broken, with Aunt Selina staring after him.
      She never did understand. I could have explained, but it was too awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the steps McGuirk turned and took a farewell glance at us. Then he
      waved his hand to the policemen and reporters who had gathered around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodby, fellows,&rdquo; he called feebly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sorry, I ain&rsquo;t. Jail&rsquo;ll be a
      paradise after this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then we went to pack our trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE FROM MAX WHICH CAME THE NEXT DAY WITH ITS ENCLOSURE.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Kit&mdash;The enclosed trunk tag was used on my trunk, evidently
      by mistake. Higgins discovered it when he was unpacking and returned it to
      me under the misapprehension that I had written it. I wish I had. I
      suppose there must be something attractive about a fellow who has the
      courage to write a love letter on the back of a trunk tag, and who doesn&rsquo;t
      give a tinker&rsquo;s damn who finds it. But for my peace of mind, ask him not
      to leave another one around where I will come across it. Max.
    </p>
    <p>
      WRITTEN ON THE BACK OF THE TRUNK TAG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t you know that I won&rsquo;t see you until tomorrow? For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, get
      away from this crowd and come into the den. If you don&rsquo;t I will kiss you
      before everybody. Are you coming? T.
    </p>
    <p>
      WRITTEN BELOW.
    </p>
    <p>
      No indeed. K.
    </p>
    <p>
      THIS WAS SCRATCHED OUT AND BENEATH.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
